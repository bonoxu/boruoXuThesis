Theory


\section{Motivation}

Since Higgs discovery in the \LHC in 2012, Higgs



Ha there is a higgs.

We found higgs. Higgs is cool. It explains mass.

Why double higgs. Double higgs coulpling is unique to linear collider. It can revel much about the BSM models.

Generator level study has performed. ILC has done this this and that. gHHH in CLIC before

Here we do things differently. First subchannels, then extract both couplings simultaneously.

Double higgs measurement

The main mechanism for double Higgs production %in \epem collisions
%at high energy CLIC ($\sqrt{s}>$\SI{1}{\TeV}) is via $WW$-fusion ($\epem\to HH\nu\overline{\nu}$). The main Feynman diagrams contributing to the process are illustrated in Figure . %The cross section for the process increases with the centre-of-mass energy: from \SI{0.15}{\fb} at $\sqrt{s}=$\SI{1.4}{\TeV} to \SI{0.59}{\fb} at $\sqrt{s}=$\SI{3}{\TeV}, assuming a %Higgs mass of \SI{126}{GeV}.
