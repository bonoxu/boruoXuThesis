%\section{Summary}

This chapter summarises key results presented in analyses in previous chapters. In \Chapter{chap:Photon}, a set of photon reconstruction algorithms developed in \pandora are presented. The photon fragments produced during the event reconstruction have been greatly reduced. The anality to separate spatially close photons and the jet energy resolution have improved, as a result of a better photon reconstruction.

For the single photon reconstruction, the reconstruction efficiency is above 98\% for photons with energies above 2\GeV, and above 99.5\% for photons with energies above 100\,GeV. For the photon fragment reduction performance using a two-photon-per-event sample with photon energies of  500\,GeV and 50\,GeV, the average number of photons and particles beyond 20\,mm distance separation are both less than 2.05, where the true value is 2. Photon pairs with the same energy, for example, 500\,GeV$-$500\,GeV photon pair and 10\,GeV$-$10\,GeV photon pair, start to be resolved at 6\,mm apart, which is about one \ECAL cell length. In contrast, photon pairs with different energies, for example 500\,GeV$-$50\,GeV and  100\,GeV$-$10\,GeV pairs, start to be resolved at 10\,mm apart, which is about two \ECAL cells length. At 20\,mm apart, 500\,GeV$-$500\,GeV photon pairs are fully resolved, whereas approximately only 60\% of 10\,GeV$-$10\,GeV photon pairs are resolved.


%500 - 500\,GeV photon pair and 10 - 10\,GeV photon pair start to be resolved at 6\,mm apart, which is about 1 \ECAL cell. For photon pairs with different energies,  for example 500 - 50\,GeV pair and  100 - 10\,GeV pair, start to be resolved at 10\,mm apart, which is about 2 \ECAL cells. At 20\,mm apart, two photons in  500 - 500\,GeV pair are fully resolved, where approximately 60\% of two photons in 10 - 10\,GeV pair are resolved.

In \Chapter{chap:Tau}, a high classification rate of the tau lepton seven major decay modes is achieved using the \eeTauTau events in the \ILD detector. The tau decay mode classification is applied the \ECAL optimisation study with different \ECAL cell sizes and different centre-of-mass energies. At \rootSGeV{100}, the tau hadronic decay correct classification efficiency, \tauHad, decreases from 94\% at 3\,mm \ECAL cell size, to 91\% at 20\,mm cell size. Most significant decrease in the \tauHad occurs at  \rootSGeV{500}, where the \tauHad decreases from 92\% at 3\,mm cell size, to 78\% at 20\,mm cell size. The increase in \ECAL cell sizes has a larger impact in tau decay classification for centre-of-mass energies above 200\,GeV, and it is more beneficial to have a small \ECAL cell size to reconstruct individual particles at these high centre-of-mass energies.

With the developed tau decay mode classification, a proof-of-principle analysis shows the tau polarisation correlations, using the \eeZZ channel where one \ZToqq and the other \ZToTauTau,  is possible to be observed with the \ILD detector model at \rootSGeV{350}. With a similar study of the \eeHZ channel where \ZToqq and \HiggsToTauTau,  the  tau decay product energy distribution with tau pair decay, where both \tauToPion, can be used to statistically identify if the parent boson is a Higgs boson or a \PZ boson.



 In \Chapter{chap:DoubleHiggs}, the analyses of the \eeToHH $\to$ \HepProcess{ \Pbottom \APbottom \PWplus \PWminus \Pnue \APnue} channel for \CLIC at \rootS{1.4} and \rootS{3} are performed. The significance of the signal events are 0.56 and 1.09,  assuming an integrated luminosity of 1500$fb^{-1}$ and 2000$fb^{-1}$, for \rootS{1.4}  and \rootS{3} respectively.  The uncertainty on measurement of the Higgs trilinear self coupling, \gHHH, from  \eeToHH $\to$ \HepProcess{ \Pbottom \APbottom \PWplus \PWminus \Pnue \APnue} analysis is obtained:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta\gHHH}{\gHHH}=
\begin{cases}
  218\%, & \mbox{at \rootS{1.4}, }  \\
  135\%, & \mbox{at \rootS{3}}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

When analysis at both \eeToHHbbWW and \eeToHHbbbb sub-channels are combined at \rootS{3} to improve the measurement, the simultaneous extraction of the uncertainty on the measurement of the \gHHH and \gWWHH yields:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta\gWWHH}{\gWWHH} \simeq 4.9\% \text{ for \gHHH = $\gHHH_{,SM}$}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta\gHHH}{\gHHH} \simeq 29\% \text{ for \gWWHH = $\gWWHH_{,SM}$}
\end{equation}
