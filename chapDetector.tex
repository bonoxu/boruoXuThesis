Since the discovery of a particle consistent with being the SM Higgs boson in LHC at 2012 \cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa}, our understanding of Standard Model has improved greatly. Yet limited by the underlying QCD interaction from proton-anti-proton collision, one has great difficulty to measure the properties of the Higgs precisely. Next generation electron-positron linear collider could hopefully make precision measurements of the Higgs sector and the Top quark sector \cite{Brau:2007zza,Linssen:2012hp}.

\section{\ILC}

Two leading candidates for next generation electron-positron linear collider are the International Linear Collider (\ILC) \cite{Brau:2007zza}, and the Compact Linear Collider (\CLIC) \cite{Linssen:2012hp}. The \ILC is a high-luminosity electron-positron linear collider with centre-of-mass energy from 200\,GeV up to 1\,TeV. The machine would be build at different stages. The first stage would have a centre-of-mass energy of 250/350\,GeV. The second stage would be 500\,GeV with a possible upgrade to 1\TeV. Thirty years of development leads to the technical design report in 2013 \cite{Baer:2013cma}. A layout of the collider complex is shown in \Figure{fig:detectorILC}.

\begin{comment}
The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a high-luminosity linear electron-positron collider based on
1.3 GHz superconducting radio-frequency (SCRF) accelerating technology. Its centre-of-mass-energy
range is 200¨C500 GeV (extendable to 1TeV). A schematic view of the accelerator complex, indicating
the location of the major sub-systems, is shown in Fig. 3.1:

The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a 200¨C500 GeV (extendable to 1TeV) centre-of-mass highluminosity
linear electron-positron collider, based on 1.3 GHz superconducting radio-frequency (SCRF)
accelerating technology. Its parameters have been set by physics requirements first outlined in 2003,
updated in 2006, and thoroughly discussed over many years with the physics user community. The
physics parameters have been reviewed continuously and found to be robust to advances in the science,
including the recent discovery of a Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

The collider design is the result of nearly twenty years of R&D. The heart of the ILC, the
superconducting cavities, is based on over a decade of pioneering work by the TESLA collaboration in
the 1990s. Some other aspects were based on the R&D carried out for the JLC/GLC and NLC projects,
which were based on room-temperature accelerating structures. Since 2005, the design of the ILC
accelerator has continued as a worldwide international collaboration coordinated by the Global Design
Effort (GDE) under a mandate from the International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA).
Drawing on the resources of over 300 national laboratories, universities and institutes worldwide, the
GDE produced the ILC Reference Design Report (RDR) in August 2007. The work done by the GDE
during the RDR phase identified several high-risk challenges that required R&D, which have since
been the focus of the worldwide activity during the Technical Design Phase. In parallel with the
accelerator effort, detailed baseline designs of two detectors have been developed by large international
teams as a result of intense detector R&D under the coordination of the Research Directorate, also
established by a mandate of ICFA.

\section{\CLIC}

The other potential next generation electron-positron linear collider,  the Compact Linear Collider (\CLIC), has a higher reach of the centre-of-mass energy up to 3\,TeV. The \CLIC is designed as a staged machine. The first stage, with centre-of-mass energy 380\,GeV, is a compromise of precision measurement between both top quark and Higgs physics. The final stage 3\,TeV is motivated by the physics reach of detecting new physics, and measurement rare decays of Higgs. The second stage is around 1.4\,TeV, which bridges between the first stage and the final stage. A layout of the \CLIC complex is shown in \Figure{fig:detectorCILC}. Due to the similarities of the two linear collider programs, the development with \CLIC detector concepts start with \ILC detector concepts. \CLICILD and \CLICSiD are developed based on \ILD and \SiD.

%Although the accelerating systems would be different, the calorimeter designs are similar, both highly granular for the optimal particle flow.

\begin{comment}
The ILC has developed two detector models, namely the International Large Detector (ILD) \cite{Abe:2010aa} and the Silicon Detector (SiD) \cite{Aihara:2010zz}. The CLIC has developed two slightly modified detector models based on ILD and SiD \cite{Linssen:2012hp}. One key common feature of these next generation electron-positron linear colliders is the high granular calorimeter, which provides a great spatial resolution at the cost of the energy resolution. Particle flow algorithms (PFA) benefit from the spatial resolution from calorimeters, together with tracking information, to provide excellent a jet energy resolution. PandoraPFA, the most complicated and the best performing one, provides a jet energy resolution of less than 3.5\%, which is required for W/Z separation \cite{Thomson:2009rp,Marshall:2013bda}.
\end{comment}





\section{Physics at future linear colliders}

The physics program for the \CLIC and the \ILC, which is a driving force for the detector design, have some common goals. \ILC has a reach of centre-of-mass from 200\,GeV to 1\,TeV, whilst \CLIC can reach from 350\,GeV to 3\,TeV. Both machines are capable of precision higgs coupling measurements, top mass and coupling measurements, search for new physics such as supersymmertry particles. The \ILC can also operate at low energy to be a \PZ and a \PHiggs factory for ultra precision \PZ mass and \PHiggs mass measurement. \CLIC, however, has the advantage of higher energy reach, which allows measurements of rare events, such as higgs  triple self-couplings and quartic couplings. The discovery potential for the \CLIC is also greater.


\section{Impact of physics requirements on the detector design}

\subsection{Jet energy resolution requirements on the detector design}
\label{sec:detectorPhysicsRequirementPandora}

The physics goal of jet energy resolution at the \ILC and the \CLIC is to separate \PW and \PZ hadronic decays via reconstruction their di-jet masses \cite{Baer:2013cma,Linssen:2012hp}. This translate to a requirement of 3.5-5\% of the energy resolution. This level of precision is unlikely to be achieved with a traditional calorimetry design. A traditional energy flow to calorimetry measures jet energies as a sum of the energy in the calorimeters. The jet energy resolution is parameterised by
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sigma_{E}}{E} = \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{E(GeV)}}\oplus\beta
\end{equation}
The stochastic term $a$ is typically greater than 60\% and $b$ is order of a few percents. For the jet energy resolution of 3.5\%, $a$  should be less than 30\% which is unlikely to be achieved by a traditional calorimeter.  On the contrary, particle flow approach has demonstrated it ability to reach the goal \cite{Thomson:2009rp,Marshall:2012ry}.

In a typical jet, using measurements on the particle composition from the \LEP\cite{Knowles:1997dk,green1998electron}, about 62\% of the jet energy is from charged particles, 27\% from photons, 10\% from long-lived neutral hadrons, and 1.5\% from neutrinos. In a traditional approach to calorimetry, about 72\% jet energy is measured in the electromagnetic (\ECAL) and the hadronic (\HCAL) calorimeters combines. The jet energy resolution is thus limited by the energy resolution of the hadronic calorimeters, which typically is $\gtrsim 55\% / \sqrt{E(GeV)}$.

The particle flow approach to calorimetry improves the jet energy resolution by fully reconstructing the four momenta of all visible particles in the detector. The jet energy is the sum of the individual particles' energies, where the energy of the charge particles are measured in the tracking detectors, and the energy of neutral particles are measured in calorimeters. In this manner, the hadronic calorimeter only measures about 10\% of the energy, which would greatly improves the overall energy measurement. Assuming 30\% of the jet energy, photon energy, is measured with ${\sigma_{E}}/{E} = 15\% / \sqrt{E(GeV)}$, and 10\% of the jet energy , which are hadrons, measured with ${\sigma_{E}}/{E} = 55\% / \sqrt{E(GeV)}$, a jet energy of ${\sigma_{E}}/{E} = 19\% / \sqrt{E(GeV)}$ can be obtained. This satisfies the jet energy resolution for separating \PW and \PZ hadronic decays. In reality, this level of performance is unattainable due to incorrect association of energy deposits to particles. At jet energy beyond tens of GeVs, the ``confusion'' rather than the intrinsic detector performance limits the particle flow performance. This has stringent requirements in the \ECAL and the \HCAL design.

The particle flow calorimetry requires to fully reconstruct particles and associate calorimeter hits to tracks. This is demanding for the software design and the detector design. The software details of the \pandora, which is a successful particle flow implementation, are described in \Section{sec:pandoraPandoraPFA}. The detector needs to be highly granular for the excellent spatial resolution to be able to correctly associate calorimeter hits to the inner detector tracks. This forms the main motivation in the calorimeter design.

 %and it is illustrated with a brief description of the particle flow principle.

\begin{figure}[tdbph]

{A typical topology of a 250\,GeV jet, simulated with \CLICILD detector concept, taken from \cite{Marshall:2012ry}.}
\label{fig:detectorJetCLICILD}
\end{figure}


\FIGURE{fig:detectorJetCLICILD} is a typical topology of a 250\,GeV jet, simulated with \CLICILD detector concept. The particles with the calorimeter hits and tracks are labelled with different colours. Clusters of calorimeter hits in the highly granular \ECAL and \HCAL are associated with tracks from the inner tracking detector, \TPC. Photons are identified using the characteristics longitudinal and transverse electromagnetic shower profiles. Hadronic showers are separated from electromagnetic showers due to the small transverse spread of the electromagnetic shower.  Therefore, the inner tracking detector should be highly efficient and has very little material. For the calorimeter, the \ECAL and \HCAL, both should be highly granular. The material of the calorimeter should be dense and has a large ratio of interaction length to radiation length.

\subsection{Other requirements on the detector design}

Other physics requirement for the detectors for the \ILC and the \CLIC are summarised from \cite{Baer:2013cma,Linssen:2012hp}.

The requirement of tracking momentum resolution is driven by the Higgs boson mass resolution via Higgsstrahlung process, \eeTo{\PZ \PHiggs}. Higgs mass can be reconstructed precisely as the recoil mass against the \PZ momenta, which is obtained via \HepProcess{\PZ \to \APmuon \Pmuon}. For the \ILC operating at \rootSGeV{250}, the momentum resolution needs to be  $\sigma_{\pT} / \pT^2 \lesssim 5 \cdot 10^{-5} GeV^{-1}$. For the \CLIC at high \sqrtS, the momentum resolution needs to be  $\sigma_{\pT} / \pT^2 \lesssim 2 \cdot 10^{-5} GeV^{-1}$.

The performance requirement of the vertex detector is determined by efficient b-quark and c-quark tagging. The ability to identify secondary vertices and tracks, which are not originated from the interaction point, is the prerequisite for the flavour tagging. The impact parameter resolution can be written as
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{d_0}^2 = a^2 + \frac{b^2}{p^2\sin^2\left(\theta\right)}
\end{equation}
where $a$ is related to the point resolution and $b$ is related to multiple scattering. The requirements for both the \ILC and the \CLIC detectors are $a \lesssim 5 \mu{m}$ and $b \lesssim 15 \mu{m}GeV$

The lepton identification are should be over 95\% for effective lepton tagging. The forward converge of the detector should be down to a very low angle. This is more critical for the \CLIC as particles are boosted at high \sqrtS.

\section{International Large Detector}

Two detectors concepts have been designed for the \ILC to deliver the physics program. Precision tests for Standard Model requires an excellent jet energy resolution and di-jet mass reconstruction. Particle Flow Algorithms based event reconstruction meets the requirement and motivates the detector designs. For the best performance of the PFA, high granular calorimeter systems and highly efficient tracking systems are designed. The requirement to separate \PW and \PZ bosons in di-jet final states requires a jet energy resolution below 3.5\%. The momentum resolution of $5\times10^{-5}$\,GeV is motivated by the Higgs boson recoil reconstruction in the Higgs-strahlung.

Motivation for two detectors is to have multiple independent measurements within one collider for cross-checking, complementary measurements and competition between collaborations. Two detectors are both general purpose detectors. Silicon Detector, \SiD, is a compact detector with a large magnetic filed of 5\,T. It uses silicon tracking modules. The International Large Detector, \ILD, is a larger detector with a time projection chamber as the main tracking unit. Both detectors have high granular calorimeters optimised for the particle flow. A view of both detector concepts can be seen in \Figure{fig:detectorILDSiD}


The International Large Detector, \ILD, is a detector concept at the International Linear Collider, \ILC. The \ILD detector concept has been optimised in the view of the particle flow techniques. Particle flow approach to event reconstruction has shown to deliver the best possible jet reconstruction with proof-of-principle implementation such as \pandora {\Chapter{chap:Reconstruction}}. Each individual particles are reconstructed with the particle flow approach. For charged particles, calorimeter hits are associated with the tracks. The measurement of charged particle relies on the excellent tracking system resolution. Neutral particle reconstruction require fine spatial resolution of the calorimeters. These form the requirements for the detector designs and optimisations.

The particle flow paradigm requires topological information for individual particle reconstruction. The sub-detector systems need to have the spatial resolution to separate charged particles from neutral particles. The result is a highly granular calorimeters with a central tracking system with excellent momentum resolution. Longitudinal cross section of top quadrant of the \ILD detector concept, taken from \cite{Brau:2007zza}, is shown in \Figure{fig:ILD} From interaction point (\IP) outwards, there is a tracking system compromising a large time projection chamber (\TPC) augmented with silicon tungsten layer, highly granular electromagnetic calorimeters (\ECAL) and hadronic calorimeters (\HCAL), muon chambers, forward calorimeters (\FCAL), magnetic coils and iron yokes. Numbers are in units of mm.

This section will describe the sub-systems of the \ILD detector concept in the \ILD technical design report\cite{}, the ILD\_o1\_v05 option in \Mokka simulation. This detector concept has been used in studies described in subsequent chapters. The \ILD detector concept has been optimised and documented in previous documents, such as the letter of intent\cite{}. The \CLICILD detector concept for the \CLIC in the conceptual design report\cite{Linssen:2012hp} is a modified version of the \ILD, adapted to the \CLIC colliding environment. The differences between \ILD and \CLICILD can be seen in \Figure{fig:detectorILD} and \Table{tab:ILDvsCLICILD}, and are addressed in the discussion below.

\begin{comment}
The ILC has been designed to enable two experiments (SiD and ILD) sharing one interaction region using
a push-pull approach. This two-detector design is motivated by the enhanced scientific productivity of
past collider facilities which benefited from independent operation of multiple experiments, providing
complementary strengths, cross-checking and confirmation of results, reliability, insurance against
mishaps, competition between collaborations, as well as increased number of involved scientific
personnel. Figure 4.1 shows the arrangement of the two detectors in the detector hall.
Both detector designs are conceived as multi-purpose detectors, optimised for the broad range
of physics opportunities at the ILC. SiD is a compact, cost-constrained detector made possible
with a 5 Tesla magnetic field and silicon tracking. Silicon enables time-stamping on single bunch
crossings to provide robust performance, derived from immunity to spurious background bursts. The
highly granular calorimeter is optimised for particle-flow analysis. The ILD group has designed a
large detector with robust and stable performance over a wide range of energies. The concept uses
a tracking system based on a continuous-readout time-projection chamber combined with silicon

In order to realise the physics program, the ILC detectors face challenges requiring significant advances
in collider detector performance. The machine environment is benign by LHC standards, enabling
designs and technologies that are unthinkable at the LHC. However, the ILC environment poses its
own set of background issues that must be overcome. The ¡°Detailed Baseline Design¡± of the SiD and
ILD detectors have been developed to achieve the requirements for all considered physics programs,
over the full range of centre-of-mass energies from 200 GeV up to 1TeV, as well as the possibility of
special running at the Z-pole.
The ILC physics opportunities place a premium on high-resolution jet energy reconstruction and
di-jet mass performance. Event reconstruction techniques based on the Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA)
have been developed to meet this challenge. This motivates highly granular electromagnetic and hadron
calorimeters and highly efficient tracking systems. New detector technologies and new reconstruction
algorithms based on the PFA approach achieve the needed precision in the reconstruction of jets of 3
to 4 percent for 100 GeV jets, set by the requirement to separate W and Z di-jet final states. The
requirements on momentum resolution for charged tracks (p/p2 of 5 ¡Á 10.5 (GeV/c).1) are driven
by reconstruction of a Higgs boson recoiling from the associated Z boson decaying to a lepton pair in
the Higgs-strahlung process. Flavour and quark-charge tagging will be available at an unprecedented
level of performance as a result of the development of a new generation of vertex detectors. Particle
identification is achieved by the highly granular calorimeters and muon identification is aided by the
instrumented iron return yoke.
A very important element of the detector design work has been the common effort to develop and
apply simulation tools to realise realistic detector-performance estimates. A small group of experts
from both SiD and ILD have cooperated closely on this critical work.
To preserve this unprecedented performance, the inner detectors must accommodate very lowmass
detectors and supports. This is a significant challenge. The detector designs have achieved the
required light-weight support structures with minimal dead spaces. This was greatly simplified by the
ILC time structure of 1 millisecond bunch trains at 5 Hertz. This very sparse filling allows power for
many of the detector subsystems to be switched off between bunch trains (so-called power pulsing),
reducing the heat load and the need for cooling. The design of these power-pulsed systems presents a
significant challenge, including the need for quiescent currents.

\section{Overview of \ILD sub-detectors}

The \ILD detector concept is designed as a general purpose detector. Closest to the interaction points are the precision a vertex detector and a tracking system. The tracking system consists of silicon tracking with a time projection chamber. Surrounding the tracking system is a high granular calorimeter system. The outer solenoid provides a magnetic field of 3.5\,T. The most outer iron return yoke acts as a muon calorimeter.


\subsection{Vertex Detector}

The pixel-vertex detector(\VTX) needs to be close to the interaction point to reconstruct secondary vertex. As the \TPC is the main tracking  detector, the \VTX mainly measures the impact parameter of tracks. The structure is three double layers with a barrel geometry. Double layer lowers the material budget and improves the impact parameter measurements. The first double layer is half length of the other two to avoid the high occupancy region of direct low omentulum hits from the incoherent pair background.



\subsection{Tracking Detectors}

The hybrid  tracking system is consists of a large volume time projection chamber (\TPC), a Silicon Inner Tracker (\SIT), a Silicon External Tracker (\SET) in the barrel region, a end cap tracking component (\ETD) behind the endplate of the \TPC, and a silicon forward tracker (\FTD) in the forward region. The \SIT, \SET, and \ETD are made up two single-sided strip layers tilted by a small angle. The \FTD is a system of two silicon-pixel disks and five silicon-strip disks.  The silicon envelope tracking system and the \TPC are shown in \Figure{fig:detectorTracking}.


The main part of the tracking system, the \TPC, can measure a large number of three dimensional spatial points. Continuous tracking allows precise reconstruction of non-pointing tracks. The \TPC is optimised for point resolution and minimum material, as required for the best calorimeter and particle flow performance.

The barrel silicon trackers improve the overall momentum resolution. They provide additional high precision space points and additional redundancy between the \TPC, the \VTX, and the calorimeters. The \FTD provide the low angle coverage which is not covered by the \TPC.


\begin{comment}
A system of silicon strip and pixel detectors surrounds the VTX detector. In the barrel, two
layers of silicon strip detectors (SIT) are arranged to bridge the gap between the VTX and the TPC.
In the forward region, a system of two silicon-pixel disks and five silicon-strip disks (FTD) provides
low angle tracking coverage.

The barrel silicon parts SIT and SET provide precise space points before and after the TPC; this
improves the overall momentum resolution, helps in linking the VTX detector with the TPC, and
in extrapolating from the TPC to the calorimeter. The coverage of the TPC with silicon tracking
is completed by the ETD, located within the gap separating the TPC and the end-cap calorimeter.
Together these systems help in calibrating the overall tracking system, in particular the TPC. The
good timing resolution of the silicon detectors relative to the time between bunches in the ILC together
with the high spatial precision helps in time-stamping tracks and assigning them to a given bunch
within an ILC bunch train.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}

The Silicon-Tungsten sampling electromagnetic calorimeters in the \ILD consist of a nearly cylindrical barrel and two end cap systems, optimised for particle flow. The \ECAL measures photon energies and separates photons from other particles. The fine granular \ECAL also sits inside the \HCAL, which hosts the first part of the hadronic showers and greatly helps to separate hadronic showers.

The particle flow paradigm has a large impact on the \ECAL design with many requirements. In addition for the \ECAL to measure and separate photons, it also needs to reconstruct detail shower profiles to separate electromagnetic showers from hadronic showers, as approximately 50\% of hadronic showers starts in the \ECAL. These requirements can be fulfilled with an excellent three dimensional granular \ECAL.

From test beam data and simulation studies, a sampling calorimeter with longitudinal and transverse segmentation below one Moli\`{e}re radius and below one radiation length at the front the calorimeter is needed. The most compact design is realised with Tungsten as absorber material and silicon pad diodes as active material. A cross section of the \ECAL is shown in \Figure{fig:detectorILDECAL}. Tungsten is a dense material with a large ratio of interaction length to radiation length. This helps to separate electromagnetic showers from hadronic showers by making electromagnetic showers transversely narrow. Silicon pad size of 5.1 by 5.1 \,mm cover large areas. They are simple and reliable to operate. The choice of thin silicon layers offers a great spatial resolution at a cost of the energy resolution in favour of the particle flow.

The longitudinal segregation is a compromise between the cost and the performance. The total 30 layers, which is about 20\,cm, provides about 24 radiation lengths. The first 20 layers use 2.1\,mm thick absorber plates, which is twice finer sampling than the last 10 layers with 4.2\mm thick absorber plates. The test beam data with electron shows the energy resolution of the \ECAL concept to be $16.6/\sqrt{E(\ GeV)}\oplus1.1\%$, which is compatible with the values assumed for the full \ILD detector simulation.

\end{figure}

\begin{comment}
The particle flow paradigm has a large impact on the design of the electromagnetic calorimeter system.
A key requirement is the capability of the system to separate overlapping showers from each other.
A calorimeter for particle flow thus needs to be able to do pattern recognition in the shower. The
electromagnetic section has a number of tasks to fulfill. It should be able to reconstruct photons
in the presence of close-by particles. It should be able to reconstruct the detailed properties of the
shower, such as shower shape, starting point and energy to distinguish early starting electromagnetic
showers from hadronic ones. It should be noted that about half of the hadronic showers start inside
the electromagnetic calorimeter. Thus an excellent three-dimensional granularity of the device is of
utmost importance.

The transverse and longitudinal segmentation of both calorimeters has been optimised based on
detailed simulation and test beam data. It has been shown that the granularity must be of the order
of X0 in all three dimensions. This implies that a sampling calorimeter is the best option for both
ECAL and HCAL. For the ECAL the most compact design can be realised with tungsten as absorber
material. For the HCAL iron is chosen as this allows an excellent energy resolution for hadrons at
manageable granularity.
For the ECAL, silicon pad diodes lead to the highest possible compactness (and effective Moli`ere
radius) and exhibit excellent stability of calibration. As an option scintillating strips with silicon
photo-sensor readout are studied, which provide a similar effective segmentation. The two technologies
can be combined in order to reach a cost-performance optimum.

In order to have a better separation of close-by showers in the calorimeter, a system with a
small Moli`ere radius is advantageous. Further help in the separation between electromagnetic and
hadronic showers can come from a large ratio between interaction length and radiation length. A
small radiation length will move the start of the electromagnetic shower earlier in the calorimeter,
while a large interaction length will reduce the fraction of hadronic showers starting in the ECAL.

The particle flow approach requires that the calorimeters are placed inside the magnetic coil,
see Sec. 1.2. This has a major impact on the layout of the detector, and on the cost. Therefore, a
compact calorimeter is preferred in order to minimise the overall physical thickness, which in turn
reduces the size of the coil. For the ECAL tungsten is a good choice for the radiator as it is dense, and
has a large ratio of interaction length to radiation length. The final system layout is a compromise
between performance and cost. The energy resolution scales with OT, where T is the individual
absorber plate thickness, while the cost scales linearly with the surface area of the readout layers. For
ILD a solution with 30 readout layers and a thickness of the ECAL of 24X0 has been chosen as the
baseline. The optimisation of the layout is ongoing.

For a chosen pad size of 5 . 5mm2 silicon pin diodes are a good choice. They can cover large
areas, are reliable and simple to operate, allow for a thin readout layer and can operate in the 3.5 T
strong central magnetic field. While the very thin silicon layers offer excellent performance for the
tracking capabilities of the calorimeter, the energy resolution is somewhat degraded. Here a less
compact device, with a thicker readout layer, will show better performance.

The requirements on granularity, compactness and particle separation lead to the choice of a
sampling calorimeter with tungsten (radiation length X0 = 3.5 mm, Moliere Radius RM = 9 mm and
interaction length = 99 mm) as absorber material. This allows for a compact design with a depth
of roughly 24 X0 within 20 cm and, compared to e.g. lead, a better separation of electromagnetic
showers generated by near-by particles. To achieve an adequate energy resolution, the ECAL is
longitudinally segmented into 30 layers, possibly with varying tungsten thicknesses. In order to
optimise the pattern recognition performance, the active layers (either silicon diodes or scintillator)
are segmented into cells with a lateral size of 5 mm.
\end{comment}

\subsection{Hadronic Calorimeter}

The requirements of sampling hadronic calorimeter is, again, driven by the need of the particle flow. The need of three dimensional granularity in transverse and logistically direction is satisfied by a sampling calorimeter.



The principle role of the \HCAL is to separate neutral hadron showers from other particles, and to measure neutral hadron energies. The neutral hadron contribution of  the jet energy is around 10\% on average. A moderate fine  granular \HCAL is a good balance between cost and performance. The chosen layout is 48 longitudinal layers with 3 by 3\cm scintillator tiles, using an analogue read out system. The layout of a technological prototype, the "EUDET prototype" is shown in \Figure{fig:detectorAHCAL} \cite{Collaboration:2011jka}.

The longitudinal system provide about 6 radiation lengths including the \ECAL, which is sufficient to contain the hadronic showers. The transverse cell sizes has been optimised for the best jet energy resolution. It is found that no substantial gain below 3\,cm and performance degradation above 3\,cm. Hence 3\,cm cell size is chosen for the \HCAL. The jet energy resolution as a function of \HCAL scintillator cell size with different jet energies is shown in \Figure{fig:detectorHCALoptimise}.

For the absorber material, stainless steel is chosen for mechanical and calorimetric reasons. Steel allows a self-supporting structure without auxiliary supports. Also steel has a moderate ratio of interaction length to radiation length.

\begin{comment}
The role of the HCAL is to separate the deposits of charged and neutral hadrons and to precisely
measure the energy of the neutrals. Their contribution to the jet energy, around 10% on average,
fluctuates over a wide range from event to event, and the accuracy of the measurement is the
dominant contribution to the particle flow resolution for jet energies up to about 100 GeV. For higher
energies, the performance is dominated by confusion, and both topological pattern recognition and
energy information are important for correct track cluster assignment.


This is followed by a highly segmented hadronic calorimeter (HCAL) with up to 48 longitudinal
samples and small transverse cell size. Two options are considered, both based on a Steel-absorber
structure. One option uses scintillator tiles of 3 . 3 cm2, which are read out with an analogue
system. The second uses a gas-based readout which allows a 1.1 cm2 cell geometry with a binary or semi-digital readout of each cell.


The HCAL is optimized to measure neutral hadrons
well and thus has to provide the topological resolution power for separating them from the showers of
the much more abundant charged hadrons which must be matched with tracks.


The transverse and longitudinal segmentation of both calorimeters has been optimised based on
detailed simulation and test beam data. It has been shown that the granularity must be of the order
of X0 in all three dimensions. This implies that a sampling calorimeter is the best option for both
ECAL and HCAL. For the ECAL the most compact design can be realised with tungsten as absorber
material. For the HCAL iron is chosen as this allows an excellent energy resolution for hadrons at
manageable granularity.

The HCAL is conceived as a sampling calorimeter with steel absorber and scintillator tiles
(analogue HCAL) or gaseous devices (semi-digital HCAL) as active medium. Due to the rigidity of
stainless steel, a self-supporting structure without auxiliary supports (dead regions) can be realised.
Moreover, in contrast to heavier materials, iron with its moderate ratio of hadronic interaction length
(.I = 17 cm) to electromagnetic radiation length (X0 = 1.8 cm) allows a fine longitudinal sampling
in terms of X0 with a reasonable number of layers in a given total hadronic absorption length, thus
keeping the detector volume and readout channel count at an acceptable level. This fine sampling is
beneficial both for the measurement of the sizeable electromagnetic energy part in hadronic showers
and for the topological resolution of shower substructure, needed for particle separation and weighting.
Two baseline technology options have been developed, the scintillator-tile based AHCAL and the
Glass Resistive Plate Chamber (GRPC) based SDHCAL.

\subsection{Solenoid}

A large superconducting solenoid outside the calorimeters produces a nominal  3.5\,T magnetic field. 


\subsection{Yoke and Muon system}

An iron yoke instrumented with scintillator strips active layers returns the magnetic flux, and acts as a muon detector and tail catcher calorimeter at the same time. The layout is shown in \Figure{fig:detectorILDMuon}. The agreed maximum magnetic field at 15\,m radial distance from the detector is 50 Gauss to ensure safety \cite{Parker:21354}. A highly efficient muon detector is provided by the 3 by 3\,cm scintillator strips. As a tail catcher calorimetry, the first layer of the muon detector, catches the energy leakage from the \HCAL and the \ECAL. It has been shown a 10\% improvement of single particle energy resolution is possible with the tail catcher \cite{CALICE:2012aa}.

\begin{comment}
the iron Yoke has been instrumented with scintillator based active layers. At the
moment tiles with 3 . 3 cm2 granularity are used, for muon detection and serving as a tail
catcher for the HCAL; this is different than the detector baseline which uses 3 cm wide and 1
m long strips;

During beam operation the IR hall has to be accessible due to the push-pull concept. Since all
activities in a high magnetic field are very cumbersome and potentially dangerous, a field limit of 50 G
at 15 m radial distance from the beam line was agreed upon [354]. Two- and three-dimensional FEM
field calculations were done using the CST EM Studio program, varying the thickness and geometry
of the iron in the barrel and end-caps until the goal of less than 50 G at 15 m radial distance was
achieved.



An iron yoke, instrumented with scintillator strips or resistive plate chambers (RPCs), returns
the magnetic flux of the solenoid, and, at the same time, serves as a muon filter, muon detector and
tail catcher calorimeter

A stable, highly efficient muon identification system with excellent hadron rejection is an important
requirement to meet the physics goals of the ILD detector. The ILD muon system provides a number
of measurement stations outside the solenoid coil, which supplement the measurements taken with
the calorimeter system and the tracker. It is used to identify the muons and to act as a tail catcher, to
recover energy which is leaking out of the back of the calorimeter. However, the barrel part location
behind the coil limits its role to fairly high momentum particles.
The muon system/ tail catcher instruments the iron return yoke in the barrel and in the forward
region. The yoke barrel part is equipped with one sensitive layer in front of the iron yoke, 10 layers
spaced 14 cm apart, followed by three sensitive layers spaced by 60 cm apart. The forward part of the
yoke is equipped with 10 layers spaced by 14 cm, followed by two sensitive layers spaced by 60 cm.
The overall layout of the muon system/ tail catcher is shown in Figure

The first layers of the muon system serve as a tail catcher, measuring the energy which leaks through
the end of the calorimeter system. Figure III-4.5 shows the effect of an ideal tail catcher (no dead
material between the calorimeter and the tail catcher) and the realistic scenario at ILD, with two
interaction lengths of material in front of the tail catcher, as a function of the total depth of the
calorimeter system. For 6 ., the value for the ILD calorimeter system, a roughly 10% improvement is
possible with the tail catcher [348].
A prototype of the muon system/tail catcher was successfully tested during the 2007-2012
CALICE test beam campaign with ECAL and analogue HCAL. A tail catcher was placed behind the
HCAL instrumented with scintillator strips and readout with SiPMs [348]. Results from the tests
show that the proposed system delivers the anticipated performance and thus validates the technology
needed to built a muon system for ILD.

\subsection{Very Forward Calorimeters}

The forward region detectors provide luminosity measurements and forward coverage of calorimeters. A system of precision and radiation resistent calorimeters are required. The luminosity calorimeter counts  Bhabha scattering to measure the luminosity to precision of $10^{-3}$ at 500\,GeV centre-of-mass energy. The beam calorimeter (\BeamCAL) extend the forward coverage, which are hit by many beamstrahlung pairs after each bunch corssing. \BeamCAL estimates a bunch-by-bunch luminosity. An additional hadron calorimeter, \LHCAL, at the forward region extends the angular coverage of the \HCAL to that of the \LumiCAL. Electron tagging is possible with the very forward calorimeters\cite{sailer2012radiation}, which aids event reconstruction at high centre-of-mass energy.

\end{figure}

\begin{comment}

At very forward angles, below the coverage provided by the ECAL and the HCAL, a system of
high precision and radiation hard calorimetric detectors (LumiCAL, BeamCAL, LHCAL) is foreseen.
These extend the calorimetric coverage to almost 4fi, measure the luminosity, and monitor the quality
of the colliding beams

Two special calorimeters are foreseen in the very forward regions of the detector [324], denoted
hereafter as LumiCal and BeamCal. LumiCal will measure the luminosity with a precision of better
than 10¡Ù3 at 500 GeV centre-of-mass energy1, and BeamCal will perform a bunch-by-bunch estimate
of the luminosity and, supplemented by a pair monitor, assist beam tuning when included in a fast
feedback system [325]. Both calorimeters extend the detector coverage to low polar angles, important
e.g. for new particle searches with missing energy signature [326]. The additional low angle hadron
calorimeter LHCAL extends the coverage of the hadron calorimeter to the polar angle range of
LumiCal. A sketch of the design is shown in Figure III-3.24.
LumiCal is positioned in a circular hole of the end-cap electromagnetic calorimeter ECAL.
BeamCal is placed just in front of the final focus quadrupole. LumiCal covers polar angles between
31 and 77 mrad and BeamCal between 5 and 40 mrad.
Due to the high occupancy originating from beamstrahlung and two-photon processes, both
calorimeters need a fast readout. In addition, the lower polar angle range of BeamCal is exposed to a
large flux of low energy electrons, resulting in radiation depositions up to one MGy per year. Hence,
radiation hard sensors are needed.

\begin{comment}
The International Large Detector (ILD) is a concept for a detector at the International Linear Collider,
ILC [198]. In a slightly modified version, it has also been proposed for the CLIC linear collider [199].
The ILD detector concept has been optimised with a clear view on precision. In recent years
the concept of particle flow has been shown to deliver the best possible overall event reconstruction.
Particle flow implies that all particles in an event, charged and neutral, are individually reconstructed.
This requirement has a large impact on the design of the detector, and has played a central role in
the optimisation of the system. Superb tracking capabilities and outstanding detection of secondary
vertices are other important aspects. Care has been taken to design a hermetic detector, both in
terms of solid-angle coverage, but also in terms of avoiding cracks and non-uniformities in response.
The overall detector system has undergone a vigorous optimisation procedure based on extensive
simulation studies both of the performance of the subsystems, and on studies of the physics reach
of the detector. Simulations are accompanied by an extensive testing program of components and
prototypes in laboratory and test-beam experiments.

View of the ILD detector
concept.
The ILD detector concept has been described in a number of documents in the past. Most
recently the letter of intent [198] gave a fairly in depth description of the ILD concept. The ILD
concept is based on the earlier GLD and LDC detector concepts [200, 201, 202]. Since the publication
of the letter of intent, major progress has been made in the maturity of the technologies proposed for
ILD, and their integration into a coherent detector concept

\section{\CLIC versus \ILC}


The two main differences between \CLIC and \ILC are the high centre-of-mass energy and the high bunch charge density leading to significant beam related backgrounds.  Within a bunch train, there is 0.5\,ns between bunch crossings at CLIC.  There are two main sources of beam induced backgroun: incoherent electron pairs from  photon (real or virtual) interactions with individual particles of the other beam, and interactions of two photons from the colliding beams. These differences leads to a modification in the detector design and the reconstruction software for the \CLIC. A comparison of \CLICILD and \ILD longitudinal cross sections can be seen in \Figure{fig:detectorILD}. A comparison of key parameters of the \ILD and \CLICILD detector concepts is shown in \Table{tab:ILDvsCLICILD}.

\subsection{\CLICILD versus \ILD}



There are two detector concepts studied in the \CLIC conceptual design report \cite{Linssen:2012hp}, \CLICILD and \CLICSiD. The \CLICILD detector concept is based on the \ILD design. They share similarities due to similar physics motivations. Only differences are highlighted here.

For the vertex detector, the first layer is moved outwards by 15\,mm due to a larger high occupancy region with higher centre-of-mass energy. The detector is also required to provided time stamping at nanoseconds level, which would be a different detector.

For the tracking detector, the same silicon-\TPC hybrid structure is used. The outer silicon tracking system is more important at the \CLIC to achieve a high momentum resolution at high centre-of-mass energy, as it is challenging using a \TPC to sperate two tracks in high energy jets and to identify events in the collection of 312 bunch crossings in 156\,ns. The solid angle coverage of the tracking detector is $12\degree \lesssim \theta \lesssim 168\degree$

The same \ECAL from the \ILD is assumed, as the requirements of a \CLIC detector are satisfied. The increased centre-of-mass energy results in extra energy leakage. But only a small fraction of particles are affected and the leakage is controlled by the \HCAL.

For the \HCAL, extra layers are added to contain the hadronic shower at high energy. The increased thickeners is justified by the simulation studies, where the jet energy resolution degrades quickly for a thinner \HCAL. To sustain the same inner bore radius, a more dense material, Tungsten, is chosen as the absorber material in the \HCAL barrel. 

The magnetic filed is increased to 4\,T  for a better performance at a high centre-of-mass energy. Due to the different magnetic field strength, the iron yoke thickness increase to 230\,cm.

The \CLICILD adopted a similar very forward calorimetry system as that of the \ILD. Dimension of the elements are changed due to a difference in the crossing angle (20\,mrad for \CLIC and 14\,mrad for \ILC). A comparison of \LumiCAL and \BeamCAL at \ILD and \CLICILD is shown in \Table{tab:detectorForwardILDvsCLICILD}.

Modifications to the design due to \CLIC 3\,TeV centre-mass-of energy can be found in \cite{Linssen:2012hp}.
