This small package provides the if-switch \ifetex which indicated whether
e-TeX is available or not.

The package can be loaded as LaTeX package using `\usepackage{ifetex}` or in
plainTeX using `\input ifetex`. In both cases it aborts silently if the \ifetex macro
is already defined.

The package currently test if \eTeXversion is defined as a primitive and
assumes e-TeX if so.
