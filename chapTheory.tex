This chapter provides a review of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, with an emphasis on the Higgs mechanism and the Higgs boson.  A general parametrisation of the Higgs theory is discussed, which supplies the theoretical background for the physics analysis in \Chapter{chap:DoubleHiggs}. Lastly a discussion of the possible usage of  the tau pair polarisation correlations as a signature of Higgs boson is presented, which motivates the study in \Chapter{chap:Tau}.


\section{Overview of the Standard Model}

The Standard Model (\SM) \cite{Agashe:2014kda,Thomson:2013zua,Tong:QFT,Gripaios:GFT} is a quantum field theory concerning the fundamental particles and three fundamental interactions of nature: the electromagnetic; the weak; and the strong interactions.  The fundamental particles in the \SM consist of bosons and fermions. The bosons mediate the fundamental forces between particles: the photon is the force carrier of the electromagnetic force; \PWp, \PWm, and \PZ  bosons are the force carriers of the weak force; And the gluon, \Pg, is the force carrier of the strong force. The properties of the force-exchange bosons are listed in \Table{tab:theoryBoson}.

Another category of fundamental particles is spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fermions. For each fermion in the \SM, there is an anti-fermion with the same mass and spin, but opposite charge. These fermions  have three generations. Each generation of fermions has the same interaction properties, but different masses. Experimental evidence of three generations include the measurements of the \PZ decay-width, which strongly suggested three generations of neutrinos \cite{ALEPH:2005ab}.

These fermions came in two distinct categories: leptons and quarks.  Leptons experience weak forces and electromagnetic forces, whereas quarks experience all three fundamental forces described by the \SM. Properties of the fermions are listed in \Table{tab:theoryFermion}.

\begin{comment}


In theoretical physics, quantum field theory (QFT) is the theoretical framework for constructing quantum mechanical models of subatomic particles in particle physics and quasiparticles in condensed matter physics. QFT treats particles as excited states of the underlying physical field, so these are called field quanta.

In quantum field theory, quantum mechanical interactions among particles are described by interaction terms among the corresponding underlying quantum fields. These interactions are conveniently visualized by Feynman diagrams, which are a formal tool of relativistically covariant perturbation theory, serving to evaluate particle processes.

In physics, a gauge theory is a type of field theory in which the Lagrangian is invariant under a continuous group of local transformations. An invariant is a model that holds true no matter the mathematical procedure applied to it. This is the concept behind gauge invariance. The idea of fields as described by Michael Faraday in his study of electromagnetism led to the postulate that fields could be described mathematically as scalars and vectors. When a field is transformed, but the result is not, this is called gauge invariance or gauge symmetry.[1] Applying gauge theory creates a unification which describes mathematical formulas or models that hold well for all fields of the same class.



The \SM also describes the interactions between sub-atomic particles. The deployment and the experimental verification of the \SM throughout the second half of the 20th century is one of the greatest triumphs of particle physics. The recent discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 \cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa} further verified the theory. This chapter summarises the \SM based on the reviews of the \SM presented in \cite{Agashe:2014kda,Thomson:2013zua,Tong:QFT,Gripaios:GFT}.



%A summary of the selected properties of these force exchange bosons can be found in \Table{}.

Another category of fundamental particles contains leptons and neutrinos. These particles are fermions. For each fermion in the \SM, there is an anti-fermion with the same mass and spin, but opposite charge. Leptons and neutrinos have three generations. Each generation has the same interaction properties, but different masses. Although neutrinos could not be directly detected, measurements of the \PZ decay-width strongly suggested three generations of neutrinos \cite{ALEPH:2005ab}. Leptons and neutrinos experience weak forces as well as electromagnetic forces.

\end{comment}

Many \SM predications have been experimentally verified. Some recent highlights included the discovery of the top quark in 1995 \cite{Abachi:1995iq}, the tau neutrino in 2000 \cite{Kodama:2000mp}, and the Higgs boson in 2012 \cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa}. However, there are observations which are not explained by the \SM. One issue is that the \SM does not incorporate the gravitational force. Another issue is that the \SM does not natively allow neutrino masses and mixings. The \SM also could not explain the existence of the dark matter. Because of these issues, there are many theories beyond the Standard Model (BSM) trying to provide an explanation for these issues. One such example is the generalisation of the Higgs theory to allow non-SM coupling strengths \cite{Kaplan:1983fs,Goldberger:2008zz}.

%The overview of the Standard Model starts with the quantum electrodynamics, and its generalisation to quantum chromodynamics. The unification of electromagnetism and the weak interaction, the electroweak gauge theory, will be discussed. Afterwards, the Higgs mechanism and Yukawa couplings will be introduced to explain masses of bosons and fermions whilst preserving the Lagrangian symmetry. This will be followed by a detailed discussion on the Standard Model Higgs boson, its mass and interactions with other particles. The chapter moves to an explanation of possible Higgs theories beyond the Standard Model, with their  Lagrangian of the Higgs interaction and observables. Lastly the discussion is provided on  the tau pair polarisation correlation as a signature for Higgs boson. This signature could be used to identify Higgs boson if an excess of tau pair decay events observed among all lepton pair decay events.

\section{Notations and conventions}

Natural unit is used in this thesis: $\hbar = c = 1$. The metric is mostly-minus, $\eta^{\mu\nu} = \text{diag}(1,-1,-1,-1)$. The Dirac gamma matrices are represented with $\gamma^{\mu}$, with $\mu\in\braces{0,1,2,3}$. $\gamma^5 = i \gamma^{0}\gamma^{1}\gamma^{2}\gamma^{3}$. $\overline{\psi} = \psi^{\dagger}\gamma^0$. Einstein summation convention is also used in this thesis.

This set of notations allow a contracted pair to be a Lorentz invariant. For a Weyl spinor, $\psi_\alpha$, the mass term in the Lagrangian is of the form $\psi^{\alpha}\psi_\alpha$, which is the Majorana mass term. The contracted pair between two different Weyl spinors would form a Dirac mass term.

\section{Quantum electrodynamics}


 \QED is a gauge quantum field theory explaining electromagnetic interactions. Quantum field theory (QFT) is the theoretical framework for constructing quantum mechanical models of fundamental particles in particle physics. Particles are treated as excited states of the underlying physical field in the QFT.  A gauge theory is a type of field theory in which the Lagrangian is invariant under a continuous group of local transformations.  Gauge invariance or gauge symmetry refers to when a field is transformed, but the Lagrangian is not.

\QED is an abelian gauge theory with the symmetry group U(1). The gauge field, which mediates the interaction between the charged spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fields, is the electromagnetic field. The \QED Lagrangian \cite{peskin1995introduction} for a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ field interacting with the electromagnetic field is given by the real part of:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr_{QED} = \overline{\psi} \left( i\Dstroke - m \right)\psi -  \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
where $\psi$ is the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Dirac field satisfying the Dirac equation, given by the Lagrangian density:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr =  \overline{\psi} \left( i\Dstroke - m \right)\psi,
\end{equation}
where $\gamma^{\mu}$ is the Dirac gamma matrices, $\mu\in\braces{0,1,2,3}$; $\overline{\psi}$ is defined as $\psi^{\dagger}\gamma^0$; $D_{\mu} \equiv \partial_{\mu} + ieA_{\mu}$ is the gauge covariant derivative; $A_{\mu}$ is the covariant four-vector potential of the electromagnetic field generated by the electron itself;  $F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{\mu}A_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}A_{\mu}$ is the electromagnetic field tensor; $e$ is the coupling constant, equal to the electric charge; and m is the mass of the electron.



\begin{comment}

\QED describes the interaction between a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Dirac field, $\psi$, and a vector field, $A_{\mu}$. The Dirac field, $\psi$, satisfies the Dirac equation, given by the Lagrangian density:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr =  \overline{\psi} \left( i\Dstroke - m \right)\psi,
\end{equation}
where


QED is an abelian gauge theory with the symmetry group U(1). The gauge field, which mediates the interaction between the charged spin-1/2 fields, is the electromagnetic field.


The natural starting point to introduce the \SM is with quantum electrodynamics (\QED). The \QED is a quantum field theory explaining electromagnetic interactions. The theory involves a spin-half Dirac (electron) field, $\psi$, and a vector (photon) field, $A_{\mu}$. When the local (gauge) symmetry is imposed, which is equivalent to the Lagrangian invariance under transformations,
\begin{equation}
\psi\ \to\ e^{i\phi(x)}\psi,\ A_{\mu}\ \to\ A_{\mu} - \partial^{\mu}\phi(x),
\end{equation}
the Lagrangian is fixed to be:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr_{QED} = \overline{\psi} \left( i\Dstroke - m \right)\psi -  \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
if up to cubic terms are allowed in the fields. Here $D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} + ieA_{\mu}$ and $F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{\mu}A_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}A_{\mu}$. There are two free parameters in \QED: $m$, the electron mass, and $e$, the electron charge. The mass term for the photon, $\nu^{2}A_{nu}A^{\nu}$, is forbidden by gauge invariance.

\QED has been verified experimentally. One of its greatest prediction is the spin magnetic dipole moment of the electron, $g_{s}$, which is predicted to be  2 from the Dirac equations, plus small corrections to the value that comes from the electron's interaction with virtual photons, so called higher ``loop'' corrections in Feynman diagrams. The current best calculated \QED prediction states $g=2.001159652181643(764)$ \cite{Aoyama:2014sxa}, where the best experimental value and uncertainty is $g = 2.00115965218073(28)$ \cite{Hanneke:2010au}. Precise agreement of the theoretical prediction and the experimental value, 1 part in \text{$10^{12}$}, is a success of the \QED.

\begin{comment}
The Standard Model of particle physics is a theory concerning the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions, as well as classifying all the elementary particles known. It was developed throughout the latter half of the 20th century, as a collaborative effort of scientists around the world.[1] The current formulation was finalized in the mid-1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks. Since then, discoveries of the top quark (1995), the tau neutrino (2000), and the Higgs boson (2012) have given further credence to the Standard Model. Because of its success in explaining a wide variety of experimental results, the Standard Model is sometimes regarded as the "theory of almost everything".

Although the Standard Model is believed to be theoretically self-consistent[2] and has demonstrated huge and continued successes in providing experimental predictions, it does leave some phenomena unexplained and it falls short of being a complete theory of fundamental interactions. It does not incorporate the full theory of gravitation[3] as described by general relativity, or account for the accelerating expansion of the Universe (as possibly described by dark energy). The model does not contain any viable dark matter particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational cosmology. It also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations (and their non-zero masses).

The development of the Standard Model was driven by theoretical and experimental particle physicists alike. For theorists, the Standard Model is a paradigm of a quantum field theory, which exhibits a wide range of physics including spontaneous symmetry breaking, anomalies and non-perturbative behavior. It is used as a basis for building more exotic models that incorporate hypothetical particles, extra dimensions, and elaborate symmetries (such as supersymmetry) in an attempt to explain experimental results at variance with the Standard Model, such as the existence of dark matter and neutrino oscillations.

\section{Quantum chromodynamics}

Quantum chromodynamics (\QCD) is the quantum field theory of strong interactions. \QCD theory is invariant under local non-Abelian SU(3) transformations. There are eight gauge bosons, gluons ( $8 = 3^2 - 1$ for SU(3)). Gluons carry three different types of colour charges, sometimes labelled as red, green, and blue. Anti-particles carry anti-colour. Quarks are associated with a single colour. Gluons are made up of a colour and an anti-colour (or superposition of colour-anti-colour pair). The \QCD Lagrangian is given by:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr_{QCD} = \sum_{f\in{u,d,s,c,b,t}} \overline{\psi_i} \left(\parenths{ i\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu} - g_{s}\gamma^{\mu}G^a_{\mu}\frac{\lambda^a}{2}}_{ij} - m_f\delta_{ij} \right)\psi_j -  \frac{1}{4}G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
where $\psi$ represents a quark  with a colour charge, indicated by $i$ or $j$; $m$ controls the mass of the quark; $g_s$ is the strong coupling constant; $a$ is the colour charge; $\lambda^a$ represents one of the eight Gell-Mann matrices; and $G^a_{\mu\nu}$ represents the gauge invariant gluon field strength tensor, given by:
\begin{equation}
G^a_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{\mu}\gamma_{\nu}^a - \partial_{\nu}\gamma_{\mu}^a  - g_{s}f_{abc}G_{\mu}^{b}G_{\nu}^c.
\end{equation}


\section{The electroweak interaction}
\label{sec:theoryElectroweak}
The electroweak interaction can be thought as an extension to \QED to incorporate the weak force - the force describing the nuclear decay. The unification of the electromagnetic and the weak force is accomplished under an $SU(2)_L \times$ U(1) gauge group. The corresponding gauge bosons are the three \PW bosons from $SU(2)_L$ ($W^1$, $W^2$, and $W^3$), and the $B$ boson from U(1), respectively, all of which are massless.

The electroweak Lagrangian can be written as
\begin{equation}
\Lagr_{Electroweak} = \Lagr_{Boson} + \Lagr_{Fermion} + \Lagr_{Higgs} + \Lagr_{Yukawa}.
\end{equation}

First consider $\Lagr_{Boson}$, given by:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr_{Boson} = - \frac{1}{4} W^i_{\mu\nu} W^{i\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{4}B_{\mu\nu} B^{\mu\nu},
\label{eq:theoryEWBoson}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
W^i_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{\nu}W^i_{\mu} - \partial_{\mu}W^i_{\nu} - g\varepsilon^{ijk}W^j_{\mu}W^k_\nu ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
B_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{\nu}B_{\mu} - \partial_{\mu}B_{\nu},
\end{equation}
where the $B$ field  is invariant under U(1) transformations; the $W$ field is invariant under non-Abelian SU(2) transformations; and the indices,$i$, $j$, and $k$, indicate three $W$ fields.


The term $\Lagr_{Fermion}$ describes the massless fermion fields coupling to the fermions, and the propagation of the fermion fields. The left-handed ($ \psi_L $) and the right-handed fermions ($ \psi_R $) are dealt differently. The right-handed fermions are singlets. The left-handed fermions are in doublets with the corresponding fermion of the same generation. The $\Lagr_{Fermion}$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr_{Fermion} = \sum_{\psi\in{fermions}} {\overline{\psi}}_L \gamma^{\mu}D^L_{\mu} \psi_L +  \overline{\psi}_R \gamma^{\mu}D^R_{\mu} \psi_R ,
\end{equation}
where $D^L_{\mu}$ and $D^R_{\mu}$ are defined as
\begin{equation}
D^L_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} + ig\frac{\tau_i}{2}W^i_{\mu} + ig'Y_{\psi}B_{\mu} ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
D^R_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu}  + ig'Y_{\psi}B_{\mu} .
\end{equation}
This structure of this Lagrangian allows $W$ and $B$ fields to couple with left-handed fermions, but only allows the $B$ field to couple with right-handed fermions. The $\tau_i$ matrices are the generators of SU(2) . $Y_{\psi}$ is the hypercharge associated with the fermion field $\psi$. The $W$ field couples with strength $g$ to the fermion field;  The $B$ filed couples with strength $g'$ to the particles carrying weak hypercharge $Y$. 

%The four vector fields ($W^1$, $W^2$, and $W^3$, $B$) are massless.


The mass of the physical bosons and fermions are obtained via electroweak symmetry breaking. Firstly a general   spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism is provided. Then the Higgs mechanism is discussed.

\subsection{Spontaneous symmetry breaking}

Consider a complex scalar field, with the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr = \partial^\mu{\psi}^*\partial_\mu\psi - m^2 \absOf{\psi}^2 =  \partial_\mu{\psi}^*\partial_\mu\psi - V\parenths{\psi} ,
\end{equation}
where m is the mass term and $V\parenths{\psi} $ is the potential of the field $\psi$. This Lagrangian has a global symmetry $\psi \to e^{i\phi}\psi$. The potential can be modified to add an interaction term without breaking the  invariance of the global symmetry:
\begin{equation}
V\parenths{\psi} =  m^2 \absOf{\psi}^2 + \lambda\absOf{\psi}^4,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ controls the interaction strength. This modified potential has a minimum at $ \absOf{\psi}=0$ for $m^2>0$. However, if $m^2<0$, the minimum of the potential occurs when:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial{V}\parenths{\psi}}{\partial{\absOf{\psi}}} =  2 m^2 \absOf{\psi} + 4\lambda\absOf{\psi}^3 = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\absOf{\psi} = \sqrt{\frac{-m^2}{2\lambda}}\equiv \frac{\nu}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{equation}
The solution that minimise the potential is not unique; it corresponds to a circle of points in the complex $\psi$ plane. By choosing any one of these points, which are degenerate in energy, the symmetry of   $\psi \to e^{i\phi}\psi$ is broken by the vacuum configuration. This phenomenon is know as the spontaneous symmetry breaking.

A consequence of the  spontaneous symmetry breaking is that the fluctuation along the degenerate energy direction, which is the circle in complex $\psi$ plane, have no associated potential energy. This is formalised as Goldstone's theorem \cite{Nambu:1960tm,Goldstone:1961eq}. In Lorentz-invariant theory, the theorem states that spontaneous symmetry breaking always implies the existence of a massless particle.

Using the example Lagrangian here, by choosing the vacuum direction and expand the $\psi$ field along the real $\psi$ axis
\begin{equation}
\psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\parenths{\nu+\psi_1+i\psi_2},
\end{equation}
where $\nu=\sqrt{\frac{-m^2}{\lambda}}$ refers to the minimum point in the potential, and $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ are real scalar fields. By substituting $\psi$ into the Lagrangian:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr = \frac{1}{2}\partial^\mu{\psi_1}\partial_\mu\psi_1 + \frac{1}{2}\partial^\mu{\psi_2}\partial_\mu\psi_2 - m^2 \psi_1^2 + \hdots
\end{equation}
the mass term for the $\psi_1$ field is $\sqrt{-m^2}$ whilst there no mass term for the $\psi_2$ field, as stated by the Goldstone's theorem.

In the previous example, the Lagrangian possesses  the global symmetry of $\psi \to e^{i\phi}\psi$. Instead, if there is only local U(1) symmetry of  $\phi\to\phi(x)$ and $D_\mu = \partial_\mu+ieA_\mu$, where $A_\mu$ is a gauge field transforming as $A_\mu \to A_\mu - \partial_mu\phi(x)$, the Lagrangian is given by:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr = \parenths{D^\mu{\psi}}^*\parenths{D_\mu\psi} - m^2 \absOf{\psi}^2    - \lambda\absOf{\psi}^4.
\end{equation}
When the field expands around the minimum of the potential of   $\nu=\sqrt{\frac{-m^2}{\lambda}}$, with $m^2<0$,  the gauge boson mass term:
\begin{equation}
+\frac{e^2\nu^2}{2}A^\mu{A}_\mu,
\end{equation}
 is obtained from the $\parenths{D^\mu{\psi}}^*\parenths{D_\mu\psi} $ term.

\section{Higgs Mechanism}
\label{sec:theoryHiggs}

The Higgs mechanism via spontaneous symmetry breaking introduces mass terms for electroweak bosons. A complex  scalar Higgs field, $\Phi_{\PH}$, transforms as a doublet of SU(2) with hypercharge $Y = \frac{1}{2}$. The Lagrangian is given by:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr_{Higgs} = \left(D_\mu\Phi_{\PH}\right)^\dagger\left(D^\mu\Phi_{\PH}\right) - \mu^2\Phi_{\PH}^\dagger\Phi_{\PH} + \lambda\left(\Phi_{\PH}^\dagger\Phi_{\PH}\right)^2,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are constant.
The $SU(2)_L\times U(1)$ symmetry of the electroweak  Lagrangian demands the covariant derivative of the  Higgs field, $\Phi_{\PH}$, takes the form of
\begin{equation}
D_\mu\Phi_{\PH} = \left(\partial_{\mu} + ig\frac{\tau_i}{2}W^i_{\mu} + ig'\frac{1}{2}B_{\mu}\right)\Phi_{\PH},
\end{equation}
where $g$ is the coupling constant of the $SU(2)_L$ gauge symmetry; $g'$ is the coupling constant of the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry; and $\tau_i$ is one of the Pauli matrixes. The Higgs potential is given by:
\begin{equation}
V(\PH) = \mu^2\Phi_{\PH}^\dagger\Phi_{\PH} - \lambda\left(\Phi_{\PH}^\dagger\Phi_{\PH}\right)^2.
\end{equation}
The Higgs potential is minimised when
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{\Phi_{\PH}\Phi_{\PH}^\dagger} =  \frac{\nu}{\sqrt{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu^2}{2\lambda}}.
\end{equation}
By expanding the Higgs field about the minimum point of the potential, the non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) can be written as:
 \begin{equation}
\angles{\Phi_{\PH}} =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
\frac{\nu}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{pmatrix}
,
\end{equation}
with a real $\nu$. Substituting the  Higgs VEV to the $\Lagr_{boson}$ in \Equation{eq:theoryEWBoson}, the gauge boson mass matrix is obtained:
 \begin{equation}
\frac{1}{8}
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
\nu
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
gW^3_\mu+g'B_\mu & g\parenths{W^1_\mu-iW^2_\mu} \\
g\parenths{W^1_\mu+iW^2_\mu} &  -gW^3_\mu+g'B_\mu
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
gW^3_\mu+g'B_\mu & g\parenths{W^1_\mu-iW^2_\mu} \\
g\parenths{W^1_\mu+iW^2_\mu} &  -gW^3_\mu+g'B_\mu
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
\nu
\end{pmatrix}.
\label{eq:theoryEWBosonMass1}
\end{equation}
Assuming there is a mixing of the $SU(2)_L$ and $U(1)$ fields:
\begin{equation}
Z_{\mu} = \cos\left(\theta_W\right)W^3_{\mu} - \sin\left(\theta_W\right)B_{\mu},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
A_{\mu} = \sin\left(\theta_W\right)W^3_{\mu} + \cos\left(\theta_W\right)B_{\mu},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
W^+_{\mu} = \frac{1}{2}\parenths{W^1_\mu-iW^2\mu},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
W^-_{\mu} = \frac{1}{2}\parenths{W^1_\mu+iW^2\mu},
\end{equation}
the gauge boson mass matrix in \Equation{eq:theoryEWBosonMass1} can be simplify to:
\begin{equation}
\frac{{\left(g\nu\right)}^2}{4}W^+_{\mu}W^{-\mu} + \frac{\left(g^2 + g^{'2}\right)\mu^2}{8}Z_{\mu}Z^{\mu}.
\label{eq:theoryBoson}
\end{equation}
Hence the gauge boson masses obtained from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the Higgs fields are:
\begin{equation}
m_{\PWplus} = m_{\PWminus} = \frac{g\nu}{2},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
m_{\PZ} = \frac{\nu\sqrt{g^2+{g'}^2}}{2} = \frac{m_{\PW}}{\cos\parenths{\theta{\PW}}},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
m_{A} = 0,
\end{equation}
where $\theta_{\PW}$ is the Weinberg mixing angle \cite{Weinberg:1967tq}, which is determined experimentally. This produces  a massless gauge boson with the $A_\mu$ field, associated with the physical photon; two massive  gauge bosons with $W^+_{\mu}$ and $W^-_{\mu}$ field, associated with physical \PWplus and \PWminus bosons; and a massive boson with $Z_{\mu}$ field, associated with physical \PZ boson. Consequently, the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the Higgs field breaks the electroweak  $SU(2)_L\times U(1)$ symmetry to electromagnetism U(1) symmetry.


\section{Higgs boson}
\label{sec:theoryHiggsBoson}

%So far, interactions between different fields in the Standard Model, as well as the boson and fermion masses obtaining mechanisms, have been discussed. The only thing left for discussion is the Higgs boson, and  interactions between the Higgs boson and other fields.

For the Higgs doublet complex field in the \SM, there are four real scalar degrees of freedom. Three degrees of freedom are ``eaten'' to form the longitudinal polarisations of the $W^{\pm}_\mu$ and $Z_\mu$ fields. The remaining one real scalar degree of freedom form the Higgs boson. To show properties of the Higgs bosons,  one can choose the unitary gauge where three degrees of freedom are manifestly eaten. In the \SM, this is equivalent to choose the Higgs field:
\begin{equation}
H(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
 \begin{pmatrix}
  0 \\
  \nu + h(x) \\
 \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $h(x)$ is the real scalar field of the Higgs boson and $\nu$ the Higgs vacuum expectation value. Higgs boson is not charged under electromagnetism as the filed is real. The coupling of the Higgs boson to other fields  can be worked out by replacing $\nu$  with $\nu + h(x)$ in previous expression. For example, the Yukawa coupling to a fermions  field, $\psi_i$, is given by:
\begin{equation}
-\frac{m_i}{\nu}h\overline{\psi}_i\psi_i ,
\end{equation}
where the $m_i$ is the mass of the fermion $i$. From \Equation{eq:theoryBoson}, couplings to gauge bosons are given by:
\begin{equation}
m^2_W\left(\frac{2h}{\nu} + \frac{{h}^2}{\nu^2}\right)W^+_{\mu}W^{-\mu} + \frac{m^2_Z}{2}\left(\frac{2h}{\nu} + \frac{{h}^2}{\nu^2}  \right)Z_{\mu}Z^{\mu}.
\label{eq:theoryHiggsBosonic}
\end{equation}
The Higgs boson self interactions are obtained from the Higgs field potential:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mu^2}{2}\left(\nu+h\right)^2 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\left(\nu+h\right)^4 \supset -\lambda\nu^2{h}^2-\lambda\nu{h}^3 - \frac{\lambda}{4}h^4 = -\frac{\Hmass^2}{2}h^2 - \frac{\Hmass^2}{2\nu}h^3 - \frac{\Hmass^2}{8\nu^2}h^4.
\label{eq:theoryHiggsSelfCoupling}
\end{equation}
Thus the Higgs boson mass satisfies ${\Hmass}^2 = 2\lambda\nu^2$. The trilinear and quadlinear Higgs self interaction strengths are $- \frac{\Hmass^2}{2\nu}$ and $\frac{\Hmass^2}{8\nu^2}$, respectively. Once the Higgs boson mass is known, $\lambda$ can be determined and the Higgs boson decay widthes and branching fractions can be calculated. For example, \Figure{fig:theoryHiggsDecayWidth} and \Figure{fig:theoryHiggsBranchingRatio} show the Higgs boson partial decay widthes and the branching ratios as a function of the Higgs boson mass for different Higgs decay modes.

Higgs boson is measured to be $125.09\pm0.24$\,GeV \cite{Agashe:2014kda}. Because the Higgs boson is lighter than a pair of heavier particles such as \HepProcess{\PWp\PWm} or \HepProcess{\PZ\PZ}, processes like \HepProcess{\PH \to \PWp\PWm} and \HepProcess{\PH \to \PZ\PZ} are forbidden kinematically. However,  the quantum field theory allows such processes to happen, as long as one of the decay products is virtual and not on the mass shell. The virtual gauge boson subsequently decays to real on-mass-shell particles. Shown in \Figure{fig:theoryHiggsBranchingRatio}, the branching ratio of  \HepProcess{\PH \to \PWp\PWm} process is the second largest for a Higgs boson mass of 125\,GeV.

%Higgs prefers to decay to the most massive possible final state. The ratio of fermionic branching ratios are proportional to fermion masses squared, modulo color factors and radiative corrections.

\section{Yukawa couplings}

The Yukawa sector of the electroweak Lagrangian provides the mass terms for quarks and charged leptons after the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the Higgs field. The   $\Lagr_{Yukawa}$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr_{Yukawa} = -\lambda^{u}\overline{q_L}\Phi_{\PH}^{c}u_R  - \lambda^{d}\overline{q_L}\Phi_{\PH}{d}_R - \lambda^{e}\overline{l_L}\Phi_{\PH}e_R + h.c. ,
\end{equation}
where $q_L$ is the left-handed quark doublet field; $u_R$ is the up-type right-handed quark singlet field;  $d_R$ is the down-type right-handed quark singlet field; $l_L$ is the left-handed lepton doublet field; $e_R$ is the right-handed charged lepton singlet field; $\lambda$ is a constant; $\Phi_{\PH}^{c} \equiv i \sigma^2{\PH}^*$ is an SU(2) doublet field with hypercharge $Y = -\frac{1}{2}$; and  the Lagrangian is summed over all possible quarks and leptons. When the Higgs vacuum expectation value is substituted in the $\Lagr_{Yukawa}$, the interaction terms become mass terms:
\begin{equation}
m_{u} = \frac{\lambda^u{\nu}}{\sqrt{2}},\ m_{d} = \frac{\lambda^d{\nu}}{\sqrt{2}},\ m_{e} = \frac{\lambda^e{\nu}}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{equation}


\section{Higgs beyond the Standard Model}
\label{sec:theoryHiggsBSM}

Since the SM-like Higgs boson discovery in 2012, it has become important to understand the role of the Higgs boson in the electroweak spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the absence of the Higgs boson, the coupling strength of the longitudinally polarised vector bosons grows with energy and becomes strong at the TeV scale. The \SM Higgs boson moderates the interacting strength, allowing the extraction of the weak coupling at short distances. In this scenario, the \SM Higgs couplings are constrained and predicted in one parameter only, the Higgs mass. But other alternative scenarios could allow the behaviour of the \SM Higgs at a low energy, but non \SM Higgs behaviour at a high energy. One such example, motivated by the hierarchy problem and the electroweak data, is that the light and narrow Higgs-scalar is a composite bound state of some strongly interacting sector at the TeV scale.   At the TeV scale, the couplings of the Higgs to fermions and bosons would be different to those in the \SM. If the composite Higgs is the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson from a spontaneous global symmetry breaking, the Higgs can be naturally light \cite{Kaplan:1983fs}. Another scenario is that a composite dilaton, the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson arose from a spontaneous scale invariance breaking, partially behaves like a light Higgs \cite{Goldberger:2008zz}. In both scenarios, the interaction of Higgs becomes strong at a high energy. The coupling of the Higgs would deviate to those in the \SM at a high energy.

An important physics channel for testing the Higgs theory is the double Higgs production via vector boson fusion at high energy \cite{Giudice:2007fh,Contino:2010mh,Contino:2013gna}. For the composite Higgs scenario, the scattering amplitude increases with energy. For the dilaton scenario, no energy dependence on the scattering amplitude is expected. It is difficult for the Large Hadron Collider to measure the cross section due to the large \SM background rate \cite{Contino:2010mh}. However, a multi-TeV linear electron-position collider, such as the Compact Linear Collider, would be able to precisely measure the cross section of the double Higgs production \cite{Barger:2003rs}.

Following the assumption made in  \cite{Contino:2010mh,Contino:2013gna}, the self interaction of the light scalar Higgs, $h$, and its coupling to other \SM bosons can be described by a Lagrangian using the notation in  \cite{Contino:2013gna}. After the electroweak symmetry breaking, the bosonic part of the Lagrangian reads:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr =\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_\mu{h}\right)  - V(h) + \parenths{m_W^2{W}_\mu^+{W}^{-\mu} + \frac{m_Z^2}{2}Z_{\mu}Z^\mu}\sqbracs{1 + 2a\frac{h}{\nu} + b \frac{h^2}{\nu^2} + \hdots},
\end{equation}
where $V(h)$ is the $h$ field potential:
\begin{equation}
V(h) = \frac{1}{2}m_h^2h^2 + d_3\parenths{\frac{m_h^2}{2\nu}}h^3 + d_4\parenths{\frac{m_h^2}{8{\nu}^2}}h^4 + \hdots ,
\end{equation}
where $a$, $b$, $d_3$ and $d_4$ are  dimensionless parameters; higher order terms in $h$ are omitted; $a$ and $b$ are proportional to the coupling strength of the $VVh$ and $VVhh$ vertices, where $V$ is the vector boson, \PWpm and \PZ; and $d_3$ and $d_4$ are proportional to the trilinear and quadlinear $h$ self coupling strength, respectively. Comparing with \Equation{eq:theoryHiggsBosonic} and \Equation{eq:theoryHiggsSelfCoupling}, the \SM Higgs suggests $a=b=d_3=d_4=1$, and all higher order terms vanish. Other BSM Higgs theory allow $a,b,d_3,d_4$ to take different values with different constraints. For example, the dilaton scenario imposes the relation, $a = b^2$.

The scattering amplitude for \HepProcess{{V}_L{V}_L \to hh} can be written as:
\begin{equation}
A = a^2\parenths{A_{SM} + A_1\delta_b + A_2\delta_{d_3}},
\end{equation}
where $A_{SM}$ is the \SM amplitude and:
\begin{equation}
\delta_b \equiv 1 - \frac{b}{a^2},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\delta_{d_3} \equiv 1 - \frac{d_3}{a}.
\end{equation}
$A_1$ grows like the squared of energy at a large center-of-mass energy, $E\gg{m_V}$. $A_{SM}$ and $A_2$ have no energy dependencies. Therefore, $\delta_b$ controls the magnitude of the increasing of the scattering amplitude as a function of energy. $\delta_{d_3}$, on the other hand, determines the magnitude at the higgs mass threshold. In an electron-positron collider, this scattering process can be studied via the \HepProcess{\Ppositron\Pelectron \to \Pneutrino\APneutrino hh} channel. The cross section of the channel can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:theoryGeneralHiggsCrossSection}
\sigma = a^4\sigma_{SM}\parenths{1 + A\delta_b + B\delta_{d_3} + C\delta_b\delta_{d_3} + D\delta_b^2 + E\delta_{d_3}^2},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{SM}$ is the cross section predicted by the \SM. With suitable kinematic cuts, high-energy behaviour can be disentailed from the physics at the threshold, allowing the extraction of $\delta_{b}$, $\delta_{d_3}$ and hence the coupling strengths, $g_{VVHH}$ and $g_{HHH}$. Suitable observables are variables that increase with the increasing of the centre-of-mass energies. Two examples of such variables are the invariant mass of the two Higgs system, $m_{hh}$, and the scalar sum of two Higgs transverse momenta, $H_T$. \FIGURE{fig:theoryMhhHtDistribution} shows that the $m_{hh}$ and $H_T$ distributions are sensitive to the values of $\delta_{b}$ and $\delta_{d_3}$. The figure shows the result of a generator-level study performed in \cite{Contino:2013gna}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{theory/MhhHtDistribution}

{Normalized differential cross sections $d\sigma/dm_{hh}$ and $d\sigma/dH_{T}$ for \HepProcess{\Ppositron\Pelectron \to \Pneutrino\APneutrino hh} at the Compact Linear Collider, with \rootS{3} after the identification cuts, for several values of $\delta_{b}$ and $\delta_{d_3}$. The plot is taken from \cite{Contino:2013gna}.}
\label{fig:theoryMhhHtDistribution}
\end{figure}

In the \Equation{eq:theoryGeneralHiggsCrossSection}, $a$, which is proportional to $g_{VVH}$, only enters as an overall factor. However, $a$ also appears in the definition of $\delta_{b}$ and $\delta_{d_3}$. To extract $\delta_{b}$ and $\delta_{d_3}$, $a$ should ideally be a constant. For a multi-TeV electron-positron collider, the cross section for single Higgs production is far greater than that of the double Higgs production. \FIGURE{fig:theoryHiggsCrossSection} shows the comparison of the cross section as a function of the centre-of-mass energy. Up to a centre-of-mass energy of \rootS{3}, the cross sections of the signal Higgs are two orders of magnitude larger than the cross sections of the double higgs production. Therefore, $g_{VVH}$, and $a$, will be measured precisely using the single Higgs production before investigating the double Higgs production. Consequently, for the purpose of measuring $g_{VVHH}$ and $g_{HHH}$ via double Higgs production, $a$ in the \Equation{eq:theoryGeneralHiggsCrossSection} can be treated as a constant.

\section{Tau pair polarisation correlations as a signature of Higgs boson}
\label{sec:theoryTauPair}
For many theories beyond the Standard Model, a common feature is that the coupling of the Higgs particle to leptons increases with the increase of the lepton mass \cite{Duperrin:2008in}.  In these BSM theories, unlike vector bosons coupling to all flavours of leptons equally, the \HigssTauTau coupling would dominate the Higgs coupling to leptons. Therefore, if an experiment observes the breaking of the lepton universality by favouring \TauTau events, it could indicate the existence of a scalar Higgs. When such a universality breaking is observed, a helicity correlation test can be used to show that the \TauTau pair is from a scalar boson or a vector boson. In particular, the polarisation correlations of tau leptons are different for \HiggsToTauTau and \ZToTauTau, as scalar Higgs decays to \TauTauSub{L}{L} or \TauTauSub{R}{R} and \PZ decays to \TauTauSub{L}{R} or \TauTauSub{R}{L}, where L, R denotes the tau lepton helicities.


Tau pair polarisation correlations can be studied using various tay decay modes. Here \Reference{Bullock:1991my} is followed and \tauToPion decay mode is used as the example. The boson decay to tau pair  via  \tauToPion can be represented as:
\begin{equation}
\HepProcess{X \to \TauTauSub{\alpha}{\beta} \to \Ppiplus\Ppiminus  + \Pneutrino's},
\end{equation}
where $X$ is either \PHiggs or \PZ; and $\alpha$, $\beta$ are the helicities, L or R. In the collinear limit where $m^2_{\Ptau}/m^2_X \ \ll \ 1$, the appropriate kinematic variables are the energy fractions:
\begin{equation}
\overline{z} = \frac{E_{\Ppiplus}}{E_{\APtauon}},\ z = \frac{E_{\Ppiminus}}{E_{\Ptauon}}.
\end{equation}
For a single tau decay, the collinear distribution can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\Gamma_{\Ptau}}\frac{d\Gamma}{dz} = Br_{\Ppiminus} f\parenths{\HepProcess{\TauFull{\alpha}{-} \to \Ppiminus} ; z},
\end{equation}
where $Br_{\Ppiminus}$ is the branching fraction of \tauToPion. The form $f$ can be obtained from literature \cite{Tsai:1971vv}:
\begin{equation}
f\parenths{\HepProcess{\TauFull{\alpha}{-} \to \Ppiminus} ; z} = 1 + P_\alpha\parenths{2z-1},
\end{equation}
where $P_L = -1$ and $P_R = +1$. For the tau pair decay, the collinear distribution is of form:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2N\parenths{\HepProcess{X \to \TauTau \to \Ppiplus\Ppiminus  + \Pneutrino's}}}{dz\,d\overline{z}} = Br^2_{\Ppiminus} \sum_{\alpha,\,\beta}^{} C^X_{\alpha \beta} f\parenths{\HepProcess{\TauFull{\alpha}{-} \to \Ppiminus} ; z} f\parenths{\HepProcess{\TauFull{\beta}{+} \to \Ppiplus} ; \overline{z}},
\end{equation}
where the only non-zero correlation coefficients $C_{\alpha \beta}$ for the party-conserving \HiggsToTauTau are:
\begin{equation}
C^{\PHiggs}_{LL} = C^{\PHiggs}_{RR} = \frac{1}{2},
\end{equation}
and for \ZToTauTau the non-zero correlation coefficients are
\begin{equation}
C^{\PZ}_{LR} = \frac{1}{2}\parenths{1 - P_{\Ptau}},\ C^{\PZ}_{RL} = \frac{1}{2}\parenths{1 + P_{\Ptau}},
\end{equation}
where tau polarisation, $P_{\Ptau}$, arises from the non-parity-conserving tau decay in the \SM. For \PZ:
\begin{equation}
P_{\Ptau} = \frac{-2va}{v^2 + a^2},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
v = -\frac{1}{2} + \sin^2{\theta_{\PW}},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
a = -\frac{1}{2},
\end{equation}
where $v$ and $a$ are the vector and axial-vector \ZTauTau couplings. \FIGURE{fig:theoryTauPairCorrelation} shows two-dimensional distributions of  tau pair polarisation correlation using both \tauToPion channel for \ZToTauTau and \HiggsToTauTau. The difference of the tau pair polarisation correlation between \PZ and \PHiggs  is clear. The distribution for \ZToTauTau has more entries along the diagonal, whilst the distribution for  \HiggsToTauTau has more entries along the anti-diagonal. Therefore, if an excess of \TauTau events over \ee or \MuMu events is observed, it can be easily identified where the excess is from \PHiggs decay or \PZ decay, using the tau pair polarisation correlation.
