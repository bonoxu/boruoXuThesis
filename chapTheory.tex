This chapter provides a theoretical overview, which will be used in the subsequent  chapters. A short review of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, the current best particle physics theory, is provided, with an emphasis on the Higgs mechanism and the Higgs boson. A general parametrisation of the Higgs theory, beyond the Standard Model, is discussed, which supplies the theoretical background for the physics analysis in \Chapter{chap:DoubleHiggs}. Lastly a theoretical discussion on the tau pair polarisation correlations as signature of Higgs boson is presented, which motivates the study in \Chapter{chap:Tau}.

\section{Overview of the Standard Model}

The Standard Model (\SM) is a quantum field theory concerning three fundamental interactions of nature: the electromagnetic, the weak, and the strong interactions. The \SM also describes the interactions between sub-atomic particles. The deployment and the experimental verification of the \SM throughout the second half of the 20th century is one of the greatest triumphs of particle physics. The recent discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 \cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa} further verified the theory. This chapter summarises the \SM based on the reviews of the \SM presented in \cite{Agashe:2014kda,Thomson:2013zua,Tong:QFT,Gripaios:GFT}.

The fundamental particles in the \SM consist of three categories: force exchange bosons, leptons and neutrinos, and quarks. In the \SM, the force exchange bosons mediate the fundamental forces between particles. For example, the photon is the force carrier of the electromagnetic force. \PWp, \PWm, and \PZ  bosons are the force carriers of the weak force. And the gluon, \Pg, is the force carrier of the strong force.

%A summary of the selected properties of these force exchange bosons can be found in \Table{}.

Another category of fundamental particles contains leptons and neutrinos. These particles are fermions. For each fermion in the \SM, there is an anti-fermion with the same mass and spin, but opposite charge. Leptons and neutrinos have three generations. Each generation has the same interaction properties, but different masses. Although neutrinos could not be directly detected, measurements of the \PZ decay-width strongly suggested three generations of neutrinos \cite{ALEPH:2005ab}. Leptons and neutrinos experience weak forces as well as electromagnetic forces.

The last category of fundamental particles are quarks, which are also fermions and have three generations. Each generation has a positively charged up-type quark and a negatively charged down-type quark. Quarks experience all three fundamental forces described by the \SM.

The \SM has enjoyed a great success with theoretical predictions being experimentally verified. Some highlights include the discovery of the top quark in 1995 \cite{Abachi:1995iq}, the tau neutrino in 2000 \cite{Kodama:2000mp}, and the Higgs boson in 2012 \cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa}. However, there are observations which are not explained by the \SM. One issue is that the \SM does not incorporate the gravitational force. There have been attempts to modify the \SM, but no conclusive theory exists yet. Another issue is that the \SM does not allow neutrino masses and mixings. Because of these issues that are not fully explained by the \SM, there are many theories beyond the Standard Model (BSM) trying to provide an explanation for these issues. One such example is the generalisation of the Higgs theory to allow non-SM coupling strengths. Many BSM theories also predict that the Higgs couples to tau leptons more strongly then other leptons. Therefore, tau pair polarisation correlations as a signature for Higgs boson is discussed.

The overview of the Standard Model starts with the quantum electrodynamics, and its generalisation to quantum chromodynamics. The unification of electromagnetism and the weak interaction, the electroweak gauge theory, will be discussed. Afterwards, the Higgs mechanism and Yukawa couplings will be introduced to explain masses of bosons and fermions whilst preserving the Lagrangian symmetry. This will be followed by a detailed discussion on the Standard Model Higgs boson, its mass and interactions with other particles. The chapter moves to an explanation of possible Higgs theories beyond the Standard Model, with their  Lagrangian of the Higgs interaction and observables. Lastly the discussion is provided on  the tau pair polarisation correlation as a signature for Higgs boson. This signature could be used to identify Higgs boson if an excess of tau pair decay events observed among all lepton pair decay events.


\section{Notations and conventions}

Natural unit is used in this thesis: $\hbar = c = 1$. The metric is mostly-minus, $\eta^{\mu\nu} = \text{diag}(1,-1,-1,-1)$. The Dirac gamma matrices are represented with $\gamma^{\mu}$, with $\mu\in\braces{0,1,2,3}$. $\gamma^5 = i \gamma^{0}\gamma^{1}\gamma^{2}\gamma^{3}$. $\overline{\psi} = \psi^{\dagger}\gamma^0$. Einstein summation convention is also used in this thesis.

This set of notations allow a contracted pair to be a Lorentz invariant. For a Weyl spinor, $\psi_\alpha$, the mass term in the Lagrangian is of the form $\psi^{\alpha}\psi_\alpha$, which is the Majorana mass term. The contracted pair between two different Weyl spinors would form a Dirac mass term.


\section{Quantum electrodynamics}

The natural starting point to introduce the \SM is with quantum electrodynamics (\QED). The \QED is a quantum field theory explaining electromagnetic interactions. The theory involves a spin-half Dirac (electron) field, $\psi$, and a vector (photon) field, $A_{\mu}$. When the local (gauge) symmetry is imposed, which is equivalent to the Lagrangian invariance under transformations,
\begin{equation}
\psi\ \to\ e^{i\phi(x)}\psi,\ A_{\mu}\ \to\ A_{\mu} - \partial^{\mu}\phi(x),
\end{equation}
the Lagrangian is fixed to be:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr_{QED} = \overline{\psi} \left( i\Dstroke - m \right)\psi -  \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
if up to cubic terms are allowed in the fields. Here $D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} + ieA_{\mu}$ and $F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{\mu}A_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}A_{\mu}$. There are two free parameters in \QED: $m$, the electron mass, and $e$, the electron charge. The mass term for the photon, $\nu^{2}A_{nu}A^{\nu}$, is forbidden by gauge invariance.

\QED has been verified experimentally. One of its greatest prediction is the spin magnetic dipole moment of the electron, $g_{s}$, which is predicted to be  2 from the Dirac equations, plus small corrections to the value that comes from the electron's interaction with virtual photons, so called higher ``loop'' corrections in Feynman diagrams. The current best calculated \QED prediction states $g=2.001159652181643(764)$ \cite{Aoyama:2014sxa}, where the best experimental value and uncertainty is $g = 2.00115965218073(28)$ \cite{Hanneke:2010au}. Precise agreement of the theoretical prediction and the experimental value, 1 part in \text{$10^{12}$}, is a success of the \QED.

\begin{comment}
The Standard Model of particle physics is a theory concerning the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions, as well as classifying all the elementary particles known. It was developed throughout the latter half of the 20th century, as a collaborative effort of scientists around the world.[1] The current formulation was finalized in the mid-1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks. Since then, discoveries of the top quark (1995), the tau neutrino (2000), and the Higgs boson (2012) have given further credence to the Standard Model. Because of its success in explaining a wide variety of experimental results, the Standard Model is sometimes regarded as the "theory of almost everything".

Although the Standard Model is believed to be theoretically self-consistent[2] and has demonstrated huge and continued successes in providing experimental predictions, it does leave some phenomena unexplained and it falls short of being a complete theory of fundamental interactions. It does not incorporate the full theory of gravitation[3] as described by general relativity, or account for the accelerating expansion of the Universe (as possibly described by dark energy). The model does not contain any viable dark matter particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational cosmology. It also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations (and their non-zero masses).

The development of the Standard Model was driven by theoretical and experimental particle physicists alike. For theorists, the Standard Model is a paradigm of a quantum field theory, which exhibits a wide range of physics including spontaneous symmetry breaking, anomalies and non-perturbative behavior. It is used as a basis for building more exotic models that incorporate hypothetical particles, extra dimensions, and elaborate symmetries (such as supersymmetry) in an attempt to explain experimental results at variance with the Standard Model, such as the existence of dark matter and neutrino oscillations.

\section{Quantum chromodynamics}

Like \QED, quantum chromodynamics (\QCD) is a quantum field theory. It explains strong interactions. There are eight gauge bosons, called gluons, coupling to nine fermions, called quarks. Unlike \QED, the theory is invariant under local non-Abelian SU(3) transformations. Gulons can interact with other gluons, and carry colour charge (red, green, and blue). Nine quarks transform as colour triplets. The \QCD Lagrangian is
\begin{equation}
\Lagr_{QCD} = \sum_{f\in{u,d,s,c,b,t}} \overline{\psi} \left( i\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu} - g_{s}\gamma^{\mu}G^a_{\mu}\frac{\lambda^a}{2} - m_f \right)\psi -  \frac{1}{4}G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
where $g_s$ is the strong coupling constant; $a$ is the colour charge; $\lambda$ is the Gell-Mann matrices; and $G^a_{\mu\nu}$ is the gluon field strength, given by
\begin{equation}
G^a_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{\mu}\gamma_{\nu}^a - \partial_{\nu}\gamma_{\mu}^a  - g_{s}f_{abc}G_{\mu}^{b}G_{\nu}^c.
\end{equation}
The last extra term in the $G^a_{\mu\nu} $, comparing to the $F_{\mu\nu}$ in the \QED, indicates the non-Abelian nature of \QCD.

\section{The electroweak interaction}
\label{sec:theoryElectroweak}
The electroweak interaction can be thought as an extension to \QED to incorporate the weak force, and to explain different coupling strength of left-handed and right-handed fermions. The Lagrangian  does not allow massive  electroweak force exchange bosons and fermions, which are explained by the Higgs mechanism  and  the Yukawa interactions in later sections.

There are four vector boson fields in the electroweak theory: three $W$ fields and one $B$ field. The Lagrangian can be divided into two parts: the bosonic self interaction part and the couplings to the fermions part:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr_{Electroweak} = \Lagr_{Boson} + \Lagr_{Fermion}.
\end{equation}

The bosonic self interaction Lagrangian, $\Lagr_{Boson}$, is given by:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr_{Boson} = - \frac{1}{4} W^i_{\mu\nu} W^{i\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{4}B_{\mu\nu} B^{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
W^i_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{\nu}W^i_{\mu} - \partial_{\mu}W^i_{\nu} - g\varepsilon^{ijk}W^j_{\mu}W^k_\nu ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
B_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{\nu}B_{\mu} - \partial_{\mu}B_{\nu},
\end{equation}
where the $B$ field  is invariant under U(1) transformations; the $W$ field is invariant under non-Abelian SU(2) transformations; $g$ is the coupling strength of the $W$ field; and the indices, i, j, and k indicate 3 $W$ fields, going from 1 to 3.

The fermionic part of the Lagrangian,   $\Lagr_{Fermion}$, has different components for the left-handed and right-handed fermions, given by:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr_{Fermion} = \sum_{\psi\in{fermions}} {\overline{\psi}}_L \gamma^{\mu}D^L_{\mu} \psi_L +  \overline{\psi}_R \gamma^{\mu}D^R_{\mu} \psi_R .
\end{equation}
$D^L_{\mu}$ and $D^R_{\mu}$ are defined as:
\begin{equation}
D^L_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} + ig\frac{\tau_i}{2}W^i_{\mu} + ig'Y_{\psi}B_{\mu} ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
D^R_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu}  + ig'Y_{\psi}B_{\mu} .
\end{equation}
This Lagrangian allows $W$ and $B$ fields to couple with left-handed fermions, but only allows the $B$ field to couple with right-handed fermions. The $\tau_i$ matrices are the generators of SU(2) (Pauli spin matrices are one of the representations of the $\tau_i$ matrices). $Y_{\psi}$ is the hypercharge associated with the fermion field $\psi$. $g'$ is the $B$ field strength.

For mass eigenstates, \PWp and \PWm bosons only couple to left-handed fermions. \PZ boson and photon couple to both left-handed and right-handed fermions. Hence, by inspection, $W^1$ and $W^2$ are associated with \PWp and \PWm. On the other hand, mass eigenstates for \PZ boson and photon, $Z_{\mu}$ and $A_{\mu}$, are mixtures of $W^3_{\mu}$ and $B_{\mu}$. $Z_{\mu}$ and $A_{\mu}$ are defined as:
\begin{equation}
Z_{\mu} = \cos\left(\theta_W\right)W^3_{\mu} - \sin\left(\theta_W\right)B_{\mu},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
A_{\mu} = \sin\left(\theta_W\right)W^3_{\mu} + \cos\left(\theta_W\right)B_{\mu},
\end{equation}
where $\theta_W$ is the Weinberg mixing angle \cite{Weinberg:1967tq}, which is determined experimentally.

So far the SU(2)$\otimes$U(1) gauge theory explains the parity violating nature of the weak interaction. However, explicit mass terms are not allowed in the gauge symmetry.

\section{Higgs Mechanism}
\label{sec:theoryHiggs}
The higgs mechanism via spontaneous symmetry breaking introduces mass terms for electroweak bosons. A complex  scalar Higgs field, $\Phi_{\PH}$, is added to the electroweak Lagrangian. $\Phi_{\PH}$ transforms as a doublet of SU(2) with hypercharge $Y = \frac{1}{2}$. The Higgs Lagrangian is therefore:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr_{Higgs} = \left(D_\mu\Phi_{\PH}\right)^\dagger\left(D^\mu\Phi_{\PH}\right) - \mu^2\Phi_{\PH}^\dagger\Phi_{\PH} - \lambda\left(\Phi_{\PH}^\dagger\Phi_{\PH}\right)^2,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
D_\mu\Phi_{\PH} = \left(\partial_{\mu} + ig\frac{\tau_i}{2}W^i_{\mu} + ig'\frac{1}{2}B_{\mu}\right)\Phi_{\PH}.
\end{equation}
For a  negative $\mu^2$, the Higgs field potential:
\begin{equation}
\mu^2\Phi_{\PH}^\dagger\Phi_{\PH} + \lambda\left(\Phi_{\PH}^\dagger\Phi_{\PH}\right)^2 ,
\end{equation}
is minimised with a Higgs vacuum expectation value:
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{\Phi_{\PH}\Phi_{\PH}^\dagger} =  \frac{\nu}{\sqrt{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu^2}{2\lambda}}.
\end{equation}
 Without the loss of generality, one can choose:
 \begin{equation}
\angles{\Phi_{\PH}} =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
\frac{\nu}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{pmatrix}
,
\end{equation}
with a real $\nu$. Therefore, after the spontaneous symmetry breaking, the $\Lagr_{Higgs}$ provides  the mass terms for \PWp, \PWm, \PZ and photon via terms in the Lagrangian:
\begin{equation}
\frac{{\left(g\nu\right)}^2}{4}W^+_{\mu}W^{-\mu} + \frac{\left(g^2 + g^{'2}\right)\mu^2}{8}Z_{\mu}Z^{\mu}.
\label{eq:theoryBoson}
\end{equation}
This provides an equal mass for \PWp and \PWm, a mass term for $\PZ$, and no mass term for photon.

\section{Yukawa couplings}

The previous section explains the Higgs mechanism for gauge bosons gaining masses. The fermions gain masses in a similar fashion. Consider a Higgs field transforming as a doublet of SU(2) with hypercharge $Y = \frac{1}{2}$, the Yukawa couplings are given by:

\begin{equation}
\Lagr_{Yukawa} = -\lambda^{u}\overline{q_L}\Phi_{\PH}^{c}u_R - -\lambda^{d}\overline{q_L}\Phi_{\PH}{d}_R - \lambda^{e}\overline{l_L}\Phi_{\PH}e_R + h.c. ,
\end{equation}
where $\Phi_{\PH}^{c} \equiv i \sigma^2{\PH}^*$ is an SU(2) doublet field with hypercharge $Y = -\frac{1}{2}$; $\sigma$ is the Pauli spin matrix; $u$, $d$, and $e$ are fields for the up-type quarks, the down-type quarks, and the leptons, respectively; and the Lagrangian is summed over all possible quarks and leptons. Interaction terms in the $\Lagr_{Yukawa}$ become mass terms when the Higgs vacuum expectation value is substituted. The fermion masses are therefore given by:
\begin{equation}
m_{u} = \frac{\lambda^u{\nu}}{\sqrt{2}},\ m_{d} = \frac{\lambda^d{\nu}}{\sqrt{2}},\ m_{e} = \frac{\lambda^e{\nu}}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{equation}

\section{Standard Model Higgs boson}
\label{sec:theoryHiggsBoson}

So far, interactions between different fields in the Standard Model, as well as the boson and fermion masses obtaining mechanism, have been discussed. The only thing left for discussion is the Higgs boson, and  interactions between the Higgs boson and other fields.

For the Higgs doublet complex field in the \SM, there are four real scalar degrees of freedom. By choosing the unitary gauge, three degrees of freedom are manifestly eaten. The Higgs field becomes:
\begin{equation}
H(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
 \begin{pmatrix}
  0 \\
  \nu + h(x) \\
 \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $h(x)$ is the real scalar field of the Higgs boson. It is not charged under electromagnetism as the filed is real. The Higgs boson interaction terms with other particles in the Lagrangian   can be shown by replacing $\nu$  with $\nu + h(x)$ in previous Lagrangians. For example, for a fermions  field, $\psi_i$, the Higgs boson interaction term is given by:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr\supset-\frac{m_i}{\nu}h\overline{\psi}_i\psi_i ,
\end{equation}
where the $m_i$ is the mass of the fermion $i$. The Higgs boson interaction terms with bosons can be shown from the \Equation{eq:theoryBoson} as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:theoryHiggsBosonic}
\Lagr\supset m^2_W\left(\frac{2h}{\nu} + \frac{{h}^2}{\nu^2}\right)W^+_{\mu}W^{-\mu} + \frac{m^2_Z}{2}\left(\frac{2h}{\nu} + \frac{{h}^2}{\nu^2}  \right)Z_{\mu}Z^{\mu}.
\end{equation}
The Higgs boson self interactions are obtained from the Higgs field potential:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:theoryHiggsSelfCoupling}
\Lagr\supset \frac{\mu^2}{2}\left(\nu+h\right)^2 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\left(\nu+h\right)^4 \supset -\lambda\nu^2{h}^2-\lambda\nu{h}^3 - \frac{\lambda}{4}h^4 = -\frac{m_h^2}{2}h^2 - \frac{m_h^2}{2\nu}h^3 - \frac{m_h^2}{8\nu^2}h^4.
\end{equation}
The Higgs boson mass, $\Hmass = 2\lambda\nu^2$. The trilinear and quadlinear Higgs self interaction strengths are $- \frac{\Hmass^2}{2\nu}$ and $\frac{\Hmass^2}{8\nu^2}$, respectively. Once \Hmass is known, $\lambda$ can be determined and the Higgs boson decay width and branching fraction can be approximately calculated. For example, \Figure{fig:theoryHiggsDecayWidth} and \Figure{fig:theoryHiggsBranchingRatio} show the Higgs boson partial decay width and the branching ratios as a function of the Higgs boson mass.

Higgs boson decaying to a pair of heavier particles, such as \HepProcess{\PWp\PWm} or \HepProcess{\PZ\PZ}, is forbidden kinematically. However, \Figure{fig:theoryHiggsPhenomenology} shows that the Higgs decaying to  $\PWp\PWm$  dominates before the mass threshold, $\Hmass = 2m_W \sim 160$\,GeV. This is   allowed by the quantum field theory, because one of the $\PWpm$ gauge bosons is virtual and not on the mass shell. The virtual gauge boson subsequently decays to real on-mass-shell particles.

%Higgs prefers to decay to the most massive possible final state. The ratio of fermionic branching ratios are proportional to fermion masses squared, modulo color factors and radiative corrections.

\section{Higgs beyond the Standard Model}
\label{sec:theoryHiggsBSM}

Since the SM-like Higgs boson discovery in 2012, it has become important to understand the role of the Higgs boson in the electroweak spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the absence of the Higgs boson, the coupling strength of the longitudinally polarised vector bosons grows with energy and becomes strong at the TeV scale. The \SM Higgs boson moderates the interacting strength, allowing the extraction of the weak coupling at short distances. In this scenario, the \SM Higgs couplings are constrained and predicted in one parameter only, the Higgs mass. But other alternative scenarios could allow the behaviour of the \SM Higgs at a low energy, but non \SM Higgs behaviour at a high energy. One such example, motivated by the hierarchy problem and the electroweak data, is that the light and narrow Higgs-scalar is a composite bound state of some strongly interacting sector at the TeV scale.   At the TeV scale, the couplings of the Higgs to fermions and bosons would be different to those in the \SM. If the composite Higgs is the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson from a spontaneous global symmetry breaking, the Higgs can be naturally light \cite{Kaplan:1983fs}. Another scenario is that a composite dilaton, the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson arose from a spontaneous scale invariance breaking, partially behaves like a light Higgs \cite{Goldberger:2008zz}. In both scenarios, the interaction of Higgs becomes strong at a high energy. The coupling of the Higgs would deviate to those in the \SM at a high energy.

An important physics channel for testing the Higgs theory is the double Higgs production via vector boson fusion at high energy \cite{Giudice:2007fh,Contino:2010mh,Contino:2013gna}. For the composite Higgs scenario, the scattering amplitude increases with energy. For the dilaton scenario, no energy dependence on the scattering amplitude is expected. It is difficult for the Large Hardon Collider to measure the cross section due to the large \SM background rate \cite{Contino:2010mh}. However, a multi-TeV linear electron-position collider, such as the Compact Linear Collider, would be able to precisely measure the cross section of the double Higgs production \cite{Barger:2003rs}.

Following the assumption made in  \cite{Contino:2010mh,Contino:2013gna}, the self interaction of the light scalar Higgs, $h$, and its coupling to other \SM bosons can be described by a Lagrangian using the notation in  \cite{Contino:2013gna}. After the electroweak symmetry breaking, the bosonic part of the Lagrangian reads:
\begin{equation}
\Lagr =\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_\mu{h}\right)  - V(h) + \parenths{m_W^2{W}_\mu^+{W}^{-\mu} + \frac{m_Z^2}{2}Z_{\mu}Z^\mu}\sqbracs{1 + 2a\frac{h}{\nu} + b \frac{h^2}{\nu^2} + \hdots},
\end{equation}
where $V(h)$ is the $h$ field potential:
\begin{equation}
V(h) = \frac{1}{2}m_h^2h^2 + d_3\parenths{\frac{m_h^2}{2\nu}}h^3 + d_4\parenths{\frac{m_h^2}{8{\nu}^2}}h^4 + \hdots ,
\end{equation}
where $a$, $b$, $d_3$ and $d_4$ are  dimensionless parameters; higher order terms in $h$ are omitted; $a$ and $b$ are proportional to the coupling strength of the $VVh$ and $VVhh$ vertices, where $V$ is the vector boson, \PWpm and \PZ; and $d_3$ and $d_4$ are proportional to the trilinear and quadlinear $h$ self coupling strength, respectively. Comparing with \Equation{eq:theoryHiggsBosonic} and \Equation{eq:theoryHiggsSelfCoupling}, the \SM Higgs suggests $a=b=d_3=d_4=1$, and all higher order terms vanish. Other BSM Higgs theory allow $a,b,d_3,d_4$ to take different values with different constraints. For example, the dilaton scenario imposes the relation, $a = b^2$.

The scattering amplitude for \HepProcess{{V}_L{V}_L \to hh} can be written as:
\begin{equation}
A = a^2\parenths{A_{SM} + A_1\delta_b + A_2\delta_{d_3}},
\end{equation}
where $A_{SM}$ is the \SM amplitude and:
\begin{equation}
\delta_b \equiv 1 - \frac{b}{a^2},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\delta_{d_3} \equiv 1 - \frac{d_3}{a}.
\end{equation}
$A_1$ grows like the squared of energy at a large center-of-mass energy, $E\gg{m_V}$. $A_{SM}$ and $A_2$ have no energy dependencies. Therefore, $\delta_b$ controls the magnitude of the increasing of the scattering amplitude as a function of energy. $\delta_{d_3}$, on the other hand, determines the magnitude at the higgs mass threshold. In an electron-positron collider, this scattering process can be studied via the \HepProcess{\Ppositron\Pelectron \to \Pneutrino\APneutrino hh} channel. The cross section of the channel can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:theoryGeneralHiggsCrossSection}
\sigma = a^4\sigma_{SM}\parenths{1 + A\delta_b + B\delta_{d_3} + C\delta_b\delta_{d_3} + D\delta_b^2 + E\delta_{d_3}^2},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{SM}$ is the cross section predicted by the \SM. With suitable kinematic cuts, high-energy behaviour can be disentailed from the physics at the threshold, allowing the extraction of $\delta_{b}$, $\delta_{d_3}$ and hence the coupling strengths, $g_{VVHH}$ and $g_{HHH}$. Suitable observables are variables that increase with the increasing of the centre-of-mass energies. Two examples of such variables are the invariant mass of the two Higgs system, $m_{hh}$, and the scalar sum of two Higgs transverse momenta, $H_T$. \FIGURE{fig:theoryMhhHtDistribution} shows that the $m_{hh}$ and $H_T$ distributions are sensitive to the values of $\delta_{b}$ and $\delta_{d_3}$. The figure shows the result of a generator-level study performed in \cite{Contino:2013gna}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{theory/MhhHtDistribution}
\caption[]
{Normalized differential cross sections $d\sigma/dm_{hh}$ and $d\sigma/dH_{T}$ for \HepProcess{\Ppositron\Pelectron \to \Pneutrino\APneutrino hh} at the Compact Linear Collider, with \rootS{3} after the identification cuts, for several values of $\delta_{b}$ and $\delta_{d_3}$. The plot is taken from \cite{Contino:2013gna}.}
\label{fig:theoryMhhHtDistribution}
\end{figure}

In the \Equation{eq:theoryGeneralHiggsCrossSection}, $a$, which is proportional to $g_{VVH}$, only enters as an overall factor. However, $a$ also appears in the definition of $\delta_{b}$ and $\delta_{d_3}$. To extract $\delta_{b}$ and $\delta_{d_3}$, $a$ should ideally be a constant. For a multi-TeV electron-positron collider, the cross section for single Higgs production is far greater than that of the double Higgs production. \FIGURE{fig:theoryHiggsCrossSection} shows the comparison of the cross section as a function of the centre-of-mass energy. Up to a centre-of-mass energy of \rootS{3}, the cross sections of the signal Higgs are two orders of magnitude larger than the cross sections of the double higgs production. Therefore, $g_{VVH}$, and $a$, will be measured precisely using the single Higgs production before investigating the double Higgs production. Consequently, for the purpose of measuring $g_{VVHH}$ and $g_{HHH}$ via double Higgs production, $a$ in the \Equation{eq:theoryGeneralHiggsCrossSection} can be treated as a constant.

\section{Tau pair polarisation correlations as a signature of Higgs boson}
\label{sec:theoryTauPair}
For many theories beyond the Standard Model, a common feature is that the coupling of the Higgs particle to leptons increases with the increase of the lepton mass.  In these BSM theories, unlike vector bosons coupling to all flavours of leptons equally, the \HigssTauTau coupling would dominate the Higgs coupling to leptons \cite{Duperrin:2008in}. Therefore, if an experiment observes the breaking of the lepton universality by favouring \TauTau events, it could indicates the existence of a scalar Higgs. When such a breaking is observed, a helicity correlation test can be used to show that the \TauTau pair is from a scalar boson or a vector boson. In particular, the polarisation correlations of tau leptons are different for \HiggsToTauTau and \ZToTauTau, as scalar Higgs decays to \TauTauSub{L}{L} or \TauTauSub{R}{R} and \PZ decays to \TauTauSub{L}{R} or \TauTauSub{R}{L}, where L, R denotes the tau lepton helicities.


Tau pair polarisation correlations can be studied using various tay decay modes. Here \Reference{Bullock:1991my} is followed and \tauToPion decay mode is used as the example. The boson to tau pair decay via  \tauToPion can be represented as:
\begin{equation}
\HepProcess{X \to \TauTauSub{\alpha}{\beta} \to \Ppiplus\Ppiminus  + \Pneutrino's},
\end{equation}
where $X$ is either \PHiggs or \PZ; and $\alpha$, $\beta$ are the helicities, L or R. In the collinear limit where $m^2_{\Ptau}/m^2_X \ \ll \ 1$, the appropriate kinematic variables are the energy fractions:
\begin{equation}
\overline{z} = \frac{E_{\Ppiplus}}{E_{\APtauon}},\ z = \frac{E_{\Ppiminus}}{E_{\Ptauon}}.
\end{equation}
For a single tau decay, the collinear distribution can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\Gamma_{\Ptau}}\frac{d\Gamma}{dz} = Br_{\Ppiminus} f\parenths{\HepProcess{\TauFull{\alpha}{-} \to \Ppiminus} ; z},
\end{equation}
where $Br_{\Ppiminus}$ is the branching fraction of \tauToPion. The form $f$ can be obtained from literature \cite{Tsai:1971vv}:
\begin{equation}
f\parenths{\HepProcess{\TauFull{\alpha}{-} \to \Ppiminus} ; z} = 1 + P_\alpha\parenths{2z-1},
\end{equation}
where $P_L = -1$ and $P_R = +1$. For the tau pair decay, the collinear distribution is of form:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2N\parenths{\HepProcess{X \to \TauTau \to \Ppiplus\Ppiminus  + \Pneutrino's}}}{dz\,d\overline{z}} = Br^2_{\Ppiminus} \sum_{\alpha,\,\beta}^{} C^X_{\alpha \beta} f\parenths{\HepProcess{\TauFull{\alpha}{-} \to \Ppiminus} ; z} f\parenths{\HepProcess{\TauFull{\beta}{+} \to \Ppiplus} ; \overline{z}},
\end{equation}
where the only non-zero correlation coefficients $C_{\alpha \beta}$ for the party-conserving \HiggsToTauTau are:
\begin{equation}
C^{\PHiggs}_{LL} = C^{\PHiggs}_{RR} = \frac{1}{2},
\end{equation}
and for \ZToTauTau the non-zero correlation coefficients are
\begin{equation}
C^{\PZ}_{LR} = \frac{1}{2}\parenths{1 - P_{\Ptau}},\ C^{\PZ}_{RL} = \frac{1}{2}\parenths{1 + P_{\Ptau}},
\end{equation}
where tau polarisation, $P_{\Ptau}$, arises from the non-parity-conserving tau decay in the \SM. For \PZ:
\begin{equation}
P_{\Ptau} = \frac{-2va}{v^2 + a^2},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
v = -\frac{1}{2} + \sin^2{\theta_{\PW}},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
a = -\frac{1}{2},
\end{equation}
where $v$ and $a$ are the vector and axial-vector \ZTauTau couplings. \FIGURE{fig:theoryTauPairCorrelation} shows two-dimensional distributions of  tau pair polarisation correlation using both \tauToPion channel for \ZToTauTau and \HiggsToTauTau. The difference of the tau pair polarisation correlation between \PZ and \PHiggs  is clear. The distribution for \ZToTauTau has more entries along the diagonal, whilst the distribution for  \HiggsToTauTau has more entries along the anti-diagonal. Therefore, if an excess of \TauTau events over \ee or \MuMu events is observed, it can be easily identified where the excess is from \PHiggs decay or \PZ decay, using the tau pair polarisation correlation.
