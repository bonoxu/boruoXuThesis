%As previously stated, this document focus on the \ILD and \CLICILD detectors. Due to the similarity, we often only discuss one detector to avoid the repetition. The difference in detectors will be stated if applicable.

Automated analysis is the only way to deal with the vast amount of data generated in high energy physics. An analysis often involves monte carlo event generations, event reconstructions, and using software to extract information of the event. Hence, reconstruction software and analyses software largely have the same purpose of extracting information. Hence they are discussed together in this chapter. Since the work is on future colliders,  monte carlo simulation is used throughout the thesis and is discussed in this chapter as well.

In previous chapters, overviews of the theory and the future linear collider experiments have been described. In this chapter, the simulation and event reconstruction chain are discussed, followed by  discussion on  common analyses software to be used in subsequent chapters. Simulation and reconstruction of events of the future Linear Colliders, \ILC and \CLIC, share a  common software framework.  Therefore,  the shared reconstruction is discussed first, and the \CLIC specific issues are highlighted afterwards. The event reconstruction is focused on the \pandora event reconstruction, which is the framework for the photon reconstruction algorithms in \Chapter{chap:Reconstruction}. Lastly analysis software and multivariate analysis are presented.   The multivariate analysis  is discussed in a separate section because of its complexity.

\section{Monte Carlo event generation}
\label{sec:pandoraMC}
Monte Carlo (MC) event generation is the first step for the simulated study. Most events, electron-positron interaction, are generated with the WHIZARD software \cite{whizard,Moretti:2001zz}, with no polarisation of the electron and positrons. Some simple events are generated manually with HEPEVT format. The PYTHIA \cite{Sjostrand:1995iq} is used to describe parton showering, hadronisation and fragmentation. The parameters for the PYTHIA are tuned to OPAL data from the LEP \cite{Alexander:1995bk}. The TAUOLA \cite{Jadach:1993hs} debrides the tau lepton decay with correct spin correlations of the day products. The Initial State Radiation (\ISR) is simulated in WHIZARD, with the \ISR photons being collinear with the beam direction. The Final State Radiation (\FSR) is simulated with default parameters in PYTHIA.

\section{Event Simulation}

For all the simulated events used in this thesis, the simulation software used is the GEANT4 \cite{Agostinelli:2002hh}. The detector geometry description is provided by the MOKKA \cite{MoradeFreitas:2002kj}.  The QGSP\_BERT physics list is used to describe the hadronic shower decay in the detector.


\section{Event Reconstruction}

With simulated events (or real data in the future) as inputs, the next step is to reconstruct these events. The Reconstruction software runs in the Marlin framework \cite{Gaede:2006pj}, as a part of the \ilcsoft. The event reconstruction contains following steps: digitisation of simulated calorimeter hits, reconstruction of tracks in the tracking system (using pattern recognition algorithms), and particle flow objects (\PFOs) reconstruction with \pandora\cite{Thomson:2009rp,Marshall:2012ry}. Details of the reconstruction can be found in \cite{Brau:2007zza,Linssen:2012hp}. Here particle flow reconstruction via \pandora will be discussed in details, as it provides the software framework for the photon reconstructions in \pandora in \Chapter{chap:Photon} and used in \Chapter{chap:Tau} and \Chapter{chap:DoubleHiggs}.

\section{\pandora event reconstruction}
\label{sec:pandoraPandoraPFA}

The tradition energy flow approach to calorimetry is unable to meet the mass and energy resolution requirements for future linear colliders. The particle flow approach with \pandora has a proof-of-principle demonstration of its capability to reach the required resolution. The particle flow approach also put stringent requirements on the detector design, which is described in \Section{sec:detectorPhysicsRequirementPandora}. By associating calorimeter hits to the tracks, around 60\% of the jet energy from charged particles is measured by the tracker, which has a much better resolution than the calorimeter. Small cell sizes of the calorimeters are required to identify hits from different particles. The traditional sum of calorimeter cell energies is replaced by particle flow reconstruction algorithms - a complex pattern recognition problem.  The \pandora algorithm has been developed and used in the \ILC and \CLIC simulation studies. There are over 60 linear collider specific reconstruction algorithms. Each aims to address a particular topological issue in the reconstruction.

Developed with the \ILD detector concept, \pandora has been adapted to the \CLIC condition and shows its ability to deliver required energy resolutions \cite{Linssen:2012hp}.  In the recent development, the core base codes for basic object and memory managements are factorised in the Pandora C++ Software Development Kit\cite{Marshall:2015rfa}.
% Recent the code base of the \pandora has been restructured.
In the subsequent sections, the main steps in the \pandora reconstructions are described. The details of the reconstruction can be found in \cite{Thomson:2009rp,Marshall:2012ry,Marshall:2015rfa}. The inputs of \pandora are digitised calorimeter hits and reconstructed tracks, with some detector geometry information to aid the reconstruction. The output are reconstructed particles with four-momenta, also known as the Particle Flow Objects (\PFOs).

\subsection{Track selection}
\label{sec:pandoraPandoraTrack}

Tracks from the inner tracking detectors are important inputs of the \pandora reconstruction. These tracks are selected based on their topological properties, how likely they are from physical processes, and whether they are consistent with the tracker resolution. Only tracks passing the selection are used for the subsequent reconstruction.

Special topologies of tracks are identified, such as when a neutral particle decays or converts into a pair of charged tracks, leaving tracks of a ``V0''  shape. This is identified by searching for a pair of tracks originated from a single point. Another topology is the ``kinks'' when a charged particle decays to a single charged particles with neutral particles. The last special topology are  the ``prongs'' when a charged particle decays to multiple charged particles. This information is stored and passed on to the subsequent reconstruction, along side with helical track fit (using last 50 reconstructed tracker hits) and the track projection to the front of the \ECAL.

\subsection{Calorimeter selection}

The other important inputs of  the \pandora reconstruction are the calorimeter hits from calorimeters. The properties of a calorimeter hit include the position, its layer in the calorimeter, and its energy response from the calorimeter digitiser.

Calorimeter hits are selected based on a series of criterion. The selected hits need to have energies above certain thresholds, measured in minimum ionising particle (MIP) equivalent or measured in directly converted energy. Similar to tracks, only calorimeter hits that pass the selection are used in later steps.

Extra information about calorimeter hits are calculated, stored and to be used in the later steps. The information includes the geometry information of the hit and likelihood of the hit originated from a minimum ionising particle (MIP).

Isolated hits, often originating from low energy neutrons in a hadronic shower, are difficult to associate to the correct hadronic shower. They are identified and not used during the clustering stage. However, these isolated hits participate in the reconstruction during the  last step, particle flow object (PFO) creation, to contribute to the energy estimation.


\subsection{Particle Identification}
\label{sec:particleID}

To improve the reconstruction of the charged particles, where calorimeter hits are associated to tracks, dedicated particle identification algorithms identify muons and photons and remove identified particles from the reconstruction. By removing the hits from muons and photons, the reconstruction of charged particles is improved as fewer hits are left to be reconstructed. Hence the pattern recognition problem is reduced. Identified muons and photons do not participate in the later clustering and re-clustering stages, but re-enter the reconstruction at the fragment removal stage (see \Section{sec:pandoraFragmentRemoval}). The details of the photon reconstruction algorithms and photon related algorithms are described in \Chapter{chap:Photon}.
%Dedicated particle identification algorithms aim to identify muons and photons before associating calorimeter hits to tracks.


\subsection{Clustering}
\label{sec:pandoraConeCluster}

A cone clustering algorithm is used to group calorimeter hits from innermost to outmost pseduo-layer. The output \clusters are further processed, merged or split based on their topological properties. Since the cone clustering algorithm widely used in many reconstruction algorithms in the \pandora, it is necessary to introduce the cone based clustering algorithm, before discussing the rest of the \pandora reconstruction.



\begin{figure}[tbph]
\centering
{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{pandora/coneClustering}}%
\caption{Illustration of the cone based clustering, taken from \cite{Marshall:pandoraLC}}
\label{fig:pandoraConeClustering}
\end{figure}

In general there are two main types of clustering algorithms: cone based algorithms and sequential combination algorithms(see \Section{sec:pandoraJetAlg}). The main clustering scheme used in the  \pandora is the cone based algorithms. The clustering algorithm forms clusters to group calorimeter hits. Illustrated in \Figure{fig:pandoraConeClustering}, cone clustering algorithm identifies a seed first, shown as the yellow dot. The algorithm then forms a cone to include hits that are within a specified opening angle to the seed hit. The cone based clustering algorithm is preferred because the direction of particle flow is largely unchanged from the originated particle, whether the particle flow is an electromagnetic shower, QCD radiation, or hadronisation.

%these cone clusters have similar direction and energy to the originated particle. Therefore it is applicable to use cone based clustering algorithms for building clusters.

\begin{figure}[tbph]
\centering
{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{pandora/coneClustering2}}%
\caption{Illustration of the clustering algorithm used  in the \pandora, taken from \cite{Marshall:pandoraLC}}
\label{fig:pandoraConeClustering2}
\end{figure}

\FIGURE{fig:pandoraConeClustering2} shows the clustering algorithm used in the \pandora. The seed for the cone clustering is typically the projection of a energetic track to the front of the \ECAL. A high  energy calorimeter hit can also be used as a seed. The initial cluster direction is taken as the direction of the seed. Afterwards, a cone with a specified opening angle and depth will be formed around the seed. The \fourMomentum of calorimeter hits are therefore summed to obtain the cone's \fourMomentum. The building of the cone is iterated from the inner layer of the \ECAL to the outer layer. At each layer, possible associations with hits in previous layers and the same layer are checked. If a hit is not associated with the cone, the hit is used to seed a new cluster. The clustering algorithm produces basic working objects, \clusters.

\subsection{Topological cluster association}

After the initial clustering, clusters are further refined using topological information. This step is necessary because the initial clustering scheme is tends to form small clusters. These small clusters are then merged  based on clear topological signatures. The merging signatures include combining track segments, connecting a track segment with gaps, connecting track segments to  hadronic showers, and merging clusters when they are within close proximity. Some association algorithms are shown schematically in \Figure{fig:pandoraTopoAsso}.  \FIGURE{fig:pandoraTopoAssoLoopTrack}, \Figure{fig:pandoraTopoAssoBackScattered}, and \Figure{fig:pandoraTopoAssoConeAsso} show rules for looping track segments, back-scattered tracks from hadronic showers, and cone association, respectively. In each case, the arrow indicates the tracks. The dark red dots represent the calorimeter hits in the associated cluster. The slightly fainter red dots represent the calorimeter hits in the neutral cluster. The black line represents the front of the \ECAL.

The slightly fainter red dots represent the calorimeter hits in the neutral cluster. The black line represents the front of the \ECAL. The figures are taken from \cite{Marshall:pandoraLC}.}
\label{fig:pandoraTopoAsso}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Track-cluster association}

Having refined the clusters in the calorimeter, the next step is to connect the clusters to the tracks from the inner tracking detector. The clusters are associated to tracks, according to the proximity of the first layer of the cluster and the track projection to the front of the \ECAL. The consistency between track and initial cluster directions, as well as a match between track momentum and cluster energy, are required.


\subsection{Re-clustering}

The cluster association scheme described in the previous section works well for low energy (less than 50\,GeV) jet. For a high energy jet, particles and the subsequent hadronic showers are more boosted and more likely to overlap each other. Therefore, it is important to re-cluster based on the compatibility of the cluster energy and the associated track momentum.

The re-clustering is performed on a statistical basis. If the cluster energy and the associated track momentum do not match, the cluster will be re-clustered using the same clustering algorithm with different parameters, or differen cluster algorithms. Afterwards, out of many clusters obtained with the re-clustering step, the cluster that matches the best with the track momentum is chosen, and the cluster will be associated with that track. A schematic diagram of the re-clustering stage is shown in \Figure{fig:pandoraRecluster}. In the figure, the black upright arrows indicate the tracks. The dark red dots represent the calorimeter hits in the associated cluster. The  slightly fainter red  dots represent the calorimeter hits in the neutral cluster. In this example, the cluster energy is less than the associated track momentum. The topological association algorithms did not add the natural cluster, as it would have formed a cluster with too much energy. The re-clustering scheme tries different cone clustering by splitting the neutral cluster so that the topological association could make correct association.

\subsection{Photon identification}

The neutral clusters are tested against an expected photon electromagnetic shower profile. The longitudinal shower profile for a photon cluster is required to be similar to a expected electromagnetic shower profile, with the discrepancy being smaller than a threshold.
\end{comment}

\subsection{Fragment removal}
\label{sec:pandoraFragmentRemoval}

This stage of the reconstruction will focus on merging low energy clusters. These neutral clusters are likely to be fragments of other clusters. The merging criterion are mostly based on the proximity and the energy comparison. Algorithms dealing with photon fragment merging and photon splitting are described in details in \Chapter{chap:Photon}.

\subsection{Particle Flow Object Creation}
\label{sec:pandoraPFOcreation}

% double counting taking care in pandora
The last stage of the reconstruction is the creation of the output objects, Particle Flow Objects (PFOs). The PFOs contain clusters and associated tracks. Simple, but effective, particle identification for electrons and muons are applied. Photon identifications are  applied at various stages of the reconstruction.

The \PFOs contain information on positions, four-momenta and associated quantities. These \PFOs are  used heavily in physics analyses. The electron, muon and photon identifications are  also used in physics analyses in \Chapter{chap:Tau} and in \Chapter{chap:DoubleHiggs}.


\section{The \CLIC specific simulation and reconstruction}

There are a few  simulation and reconstruction issues specific to the \CLIC, which affect the analysis in \Chapter{chap:DoubleHiggs}. One issue is that the luminosity spectrum for  interactions with photon from Beamstrahlung is different to electron-positron interactions. Therefore a solution is presented in \Section{sec:pandoraCLUClumi} to correct for the differences. Another issue is that there is a large amount of beam induced background in \CLIC, which needs to be suppressed before physics analyses. The background suppression is described in \Section{sec:pandoraggHad}. Lastly simulated masses of particles are given in \Table{tab:pandoraCLICparticleMass}, which will be used in \Section{sec:doubleHiggsJetOptimisation}.

%One issue is that the event reconstruction does not include calorimeters hits in the forward calorimeters due to computational reasons. Instead, a fast simulation using MC particles is used and details are laid out in \Section{sec:doubleHiggsForwardElectron}.




\subsection{Luminosity spectrum}
\label{sec:pandoraCLUClumi}

The electron-photon interaction, where the photon is produced from initial state radiation via Beamstrahlung ,  has a different  instantaneous luminosity than the electron-positron interaction. Hence, for the same time-frame, the total integrated luminosity of the electron-photon interaction is different to that of the electron-positron interaction. To correct for the difference in the luminosity, a simulated study \cite{Sailer:lumi} was performed with the GUINEAPIG \cite{Schulte:1999tx} and was simulated in the WHIZARD, to identify the ratio of the integrated luminosity of the  electron-photon interaction to the electron-positron interaction.  The results are summarised in \Table{tab:reconstrcutionBSlumi}. For the physics analysis in \Chapter{chap:DoubleHiggs}, event number for processes with initial-state photons from Beamstrahlung are corrected with the ratios in \Table{tab:reconstrcutionBSlumi}.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\label{tab:reconstrcutionBSlumi}
\end{table}

\subsection{Beam induced backgrounds}
\label{sec:pandoraggHad}

The other issue considered when using the \CLICILD detector concept is the beam induced background. At high \sqrtS, the background becomes important for the event reconstruction. Therefore, the beam induced background are considered in the simulation.

There are different types of the beam induced background. The dominant one, \ggHad, intergraded over 60 bunch crossing,  is overlayed onto the reconstruction. The \ggHad is the dominant background in all calorimeters except inner part of the \HCAL endcap. Another type of the background, the incoherent pairs,  are ignored.

These \ggHad background events are hadronised with the PYTHIA, and superimposed on the physics process simulations to save computational resources. The choice of 60 bunch crossings is a conservative estimate  of  the amount of background in the experiment condition\cite{Barklow:1443518,Barklow:1443518}.

The beam induced background deposits significant amounts of energies in the detector. It needs to be suppressed for physics analyses, like the one in \Chapter{chap:DoubleHiggs}. Two software have been developed to suppress these background: a track selector and a PFO selector\cite{Marshall:2012ry}.

The track selector aims to remove poor quality and fake tracks that are more likely from the beam induced background. It places a simple track-quality cut and a time-of-arrival cut on tracks. If the arrival time of the track at the front of the \ECAL, using the helical fit, differs more than 50\,ns from using a straight line fit, the track will be rejected.


The PFO selector discards PFOs that are originated from the beam induced background, based on the transverse momentum (\pT) and time information of the PFOs. The PFOs from \ggHad often have low \pT and have a range of time-of-arrivals. In contrast, the PFOs from physics processes have a range of \pT, and the time-of-arrivals are close to the brunch crossing time. By utilising the high spatial resolution from the high granular calorimeter, individual PFOs can be tracked and reconstructed. The PFO selector uses different \pT and time cuts for the central part of the detector and for the forward part of the detector. There are different cuts for photons, neutral PFOs, and charged PFOs. Three configurations of these cuts are developed, namely ``loose'', ``normal'', and ``tight'' selections. As the name suggested, ``loose'' selection corresponds to a looser cut of \pT and time-of-arrival, allows a larger value of \pT and time-of-arrival. The optimal configuration depends on the \sqrtS of the collision, and the physics process to study. \FIGURE{fig:pandoraEvtDisplayggHad} shows the effect of the suppression of the background with the tight \PFO selection. Reconstructed particles for a time window of 10\,ns (100 \,ns in \HCAL barrel) in a simulated \HepProcess{\Pep\Pem \to \PHiggs\PHiggs \to \Ptop\APbottom\Pbottom\APtop} event in the \CLICILD dectro, with 60 bunch crossings of \ggHad background overlaid in \Figure{fig:pandoraEvtDisplayggHad1}. The effect of applying tight \PFO section cuts is shown in \Figure{fig:pandoraEvtDisplayggHad2}.

\subsection{\CLIC simulated particle masses}
\label{sec:pandoraCLICsimMass}

Another information used in the analysis (\Section{sec:doubleHiggsJetOptimisation}) with the \CLIC detector concept is the simulated mass and width of quarks and bosons. These values are listed in \Table{tab:pandoraCLICparticleMass} and are used for generating Standard Model samples.

\section{Analysis software}

In the previous sections the automated reconstruction tools are described in detail. This section is dedicated to the common automated analysis software, which will be used in the analysis described in subsequent chapters.

\subsection{Monte Carlo truth linker}
\label{sec:pandoraMCtruthLink}
It is extremely useful to be able to associate reconstructed objects to the Monte Carlo (MC) simulated particles, to develop algorithms or to optimise event selection. The MC truth linker processor provides the link between a MC particle and a  reconstructed calorimeter hit. From the link, the main MC particle, contributing to a reconstructed \PFO or a group of \PFOs (jet), can be determined.

\subsection{Jet algorithms}
\label{sec:pandoraJetAlg}

For the linear collider, thanks to the high granular calorimeter and advance PFA software, the starting point for analysis are individual Particle Flow Objects (PFOs), as well as individual tracks. Each of the PFOs encodes four-momentum and position information. At the same time, tracks would have momentum and position information. However, sometimes it is useful to group PFOs and tracks into jets, which are the results of hadronisation processes from high energy particles like quarks or gulons.

A jet is typically a visually obvious structure in an event display. The momentum and the direction of a jet tend to resemble the original particle. Despite the relative simplicity of identifying jets visually, it is a challenge for a pattern recognition program to identify jets effectively and efficiently. Early work on jet finding started in 1977 \cite{Sterman:1977wj}, where later development can be found in reviews \cite{Moretti:1998qx,Salam:2009jx,Ali:2010tw}. This section is based on these reviews.

There are two large families of jet finding algorithm: cone based algorithms, and sequential combination algorithms. The cone based algorithms are briefly discussed in \Section{sec:pandoraConeCluster} in the context of the \pandora reconstruction. Here the focus is on the sequential combination algorithms.

Sequential combination algorithms typically calculate a pair-wise distance metric between a seed and a other particle. Pairs with the smallest metric are combined into a jet. The distance metric will be updated after a combination. This procedure is repeated until some stopping criterion are satisfied. The different jet algorithms typically differ in the distance metric and stopping criterion.
%, and a pair with smallest metric will be combined.

The chosen jet algorithm implementation for this thesis is the FastJet C++ software package \cite{Cacciari:2011ma,Cacciari:2005hq}, providing a wide range of jet finding algorithms. The implementation in the Marlin software package is called the MarlinFastJet. The symbols in the subsequent discussion follow the convention in \cite{Cacciari:2011ma}.

\subsubsection{\kt algorithm}

Longitudinally-invariant \kt algorithm \cite{Catani:1993hr,Ellis:1993tq} is one of the common sequential combination algorithms for \pp collider experiments. There are two variants: inclusive and exclusive. In the inclusive variant, the symmetrical pair-wise distance metric between particle $i$ and $j$, $d_{ij}$ or $d_{ji}$, and the beam distance, $d_{iB}$, are defined as
\begin{equation}
&d_{ij} = d_{ji} = \min\!\parenths{\pT_{i}^{2},\!\pT_{j}^{2}}\frac{\DeltaOf{R_{ij}^{2}}}{R^{2}}, \\
&d_{iB} = \pT_{i}^2,
\end{equation}
where $\pT_{i}$ is the transverse momentum of particle $i$ with respect to the beam ($z$) direction, and $\DeltaOf{R_{ij}^{2}}$ is the measurement of angular separation of particle $i$ and $j$, defined as $\DeltaOf{R_{ij}^{2}} = \parenths{y_i - y_j}^2 + \parenths{\phi_i - \phi_j}^2$, where $y_i = \frac{1}{2}\ln\!\frac{E_i + {p_z}_i}{E_i - {p_z}_i}$ and $\phi_i$ are particle $i$'s rapidity and azimuthal angle. $R$ is a free parameter controlling the jet radius.

If $d_{ij} < d_{iB}$, particle $i$ and $j$ are merged, with the \fourMomentum of particle $i$ updated as the sum of the two particles. Otherwise, particle $i$ is set to be a final jet, and deleted from the particle list. The above procedure is repeated until no particles are left.

The exclusive variant is similar to the inclusive variant. First difference is that when  $d_{iB} < d_{ij}$, particle $i$ is discarded and part of the beam jet. The beam jet contains particles that are considered from the beam induced background. The beam jet is not used as a output. The second difference is that when both $d_{ij}$ and $d_{iB}$ are above some threshold, $d_{cut}$, the clustering will stop. In practise, the exclusive mode allows a specified number of jets to be found, which will automatically choose the $d_{cut}$. The inclusive mode would find as many jets as the algorithm allows. An example usage of the exclusive \kt algorithm can be found in \Section{sec:doubleHiggsJetOptimisation}.

\subsubsection{Durham algorithm}
\label{sec:pandoraJetDurham}
The Durham algorithm \cite{Catani:1991hj}, also known as \ee \kt algorithm, is commonly used for the \ee collider experiments. It has a single distance metric:
\begin{equation}
d_{ij} = 2\min\!\parenths{E_i^2,\!E_j^2}\!\parenths{1 - \cosOf{\theta_{ij}}},
\end{equation}
where $E_i$ is the energy of particle $i$. $\theta_{ij}$ is the polar angle difference between particle $i$ and $j$. The Durham algorithm can only be run at exclusive mode, which means that the clustering will stop when $d_{ij}$ is above some threshold, $d_{cut}$.

Compared to the \kt algorithm, it uses energy instead of \pT in the distance metric, and it does not have a beam jet. This is because that for the \ee collider at low centre-of-mass energies, the beam induced background is not severe and the collisions energies are known.

\subsubsection{Jet algorithm for the \CLIC}

Although \CLIC is a \ee collider, the significant beam-induced background adds a large amount of energy. Therefore, traditional \ee jet algorithms, like the Durham algorithm, is not suitable for the \CLIC collision environment. Studies have shown that jet algorithms for the \pp colliders give better performances for the \CLIC \cite{Linssen:2012hp,LCD-Note-2010-006}.

%A more recent attempt at marrying merits from both the Durham and the \kt algorithms has resulted in the Valencia jet algorithm \cite{Boronat:2014hva}. It has shown promising improvement compared to the \kt algorithm.

\begin{comment}
\subsubsection{The \y{} parameter}
\label{sec:pandoraYparameter}
The \y{} parameter is calculated for each specific jet algorithm. It is a measure of the number of jets in an event. The \y{} parameter describes the transition of  the exclusive jet algorithm going from $N$ clustered jets to $N\!+\!1$ clustered jets. For example, $\y{23}$ would be the $d_{cut}$ value for a exclusive jet algorithm, above which the jet algorithm returns 2 jets, below which the jet algorithm returns 3 jets. Numerically the \y{} parameter is often much smaller than one. A typically way to convert the small number to a human acceptable range is to take the negative logarithm of the number.

\subsection{The \lcfiplus}
\label{sec:pandoraLCFI}
Another useful analysis technique is to identify jets from \Pbottom and \Pcharm quarks. These jets have signatory topologies. A combination of vertex finding and multivariate analysis is used to identify \Pbottom and \Pcharm jets.

The flavour tagging processor, \lcfiplus \cite{Suehara:2015ura} is based on the LCFIVertex package \cite{Bailey:2009ui}, which was used in the simulation studies for the \ILCloi \cite{Abe:2010aa,Aihara:2009ad} and the \CLICcdr \cite{Linssen:2012hp}.  The current software is modular and can be used in any order. However here it will be described in the order used in a physics analysis.

%The current software is built for a future \ee collider.

The inputs are \PFOs. The vertex finding algorithms perform vertex fitting and identify primary and secondary vertices. There is a ``V0'' particle rejection step in which neutral particles decay into pairs of charged particles. The topology is similar to the decay of \Pbottom or \Pcharm hadrons. Hence it is important to remove the V0 particles to improve the heavy quark flavour tagging (see \Section{sec:pandoraPandoraTrack} for a similar V0 rejection).

Once the primary and secondary vertices are found, \PFOs are clustered in to jets. This jet clustering scheme ensures that the secondary vertices and the muons, identified from semi-leptonic decay, fall into the same jet. Therefore, it is consistent with  hadronic decay. The jet algorithms used are Durham and Durham modified algorithms(see \Section{sec:pandoraJetDurham}).

The next step is to refine vertices to improve the \Pbottom jet identification from the \Pcharm jet. Since the existence of two close by vertices is strongly correlated to a \Pbottom jet, the vertices refining step will reconstruct as many secondary vertices correctly as possible.

The last step is to gather the information about vertices and jets, and deploy a multivariate analysis. The multivariate classier used, Boosted Decision Tree,  is implemented in the TMVA software package \cite{Hocker:2007ht}. A series of flavour sensitive variables are calculated, and the classification is divided into four subset: jets with zero, one, or two properly reconstructed vertices, or a single-track pseudo-vertex. For each subset, a jet can either be classified to a \Pbottom jet, a \Pcharm jet, or a light flavour quark jet (\Pup, \Pdown or \Pstrange). The multiclass classifier's response is normalised across different subset, and they will be referred in the subsequent physics analysis as the tag value.

%The samples for training the multiclass classifier are \HepProcess{\Pep \Pem \to \PZ \APnu \Pnu} at \rootS{1.4}, where \PZ decays to \HepProcess{\Pbottom\APbottom}, \HepProcess{\Pcharm\APcharm}, or \HepProcess{\Pup\APup/\Pdown\APdown/\Pstrange\APstrange}.

The flavour tagging is performed after the initial jet reconstruction, and all the \PFOs in the reconstructed jets are input into the \lcfiplus flavour tagging processor. Therefore, the classifier in the \lcfiplus processor is trained for a specific \PFO collection and a specific jet reconstruction algorithm. The outputs of the processor for a jet are three values, corresponding to the likelihood of the jet being a \Pbottom jet, a \Pcharm jet, or a light flavour quark jet.

%In this analysis, the classifier is trained with the optimal jet reinstruction choice, discussed in \Section{sec:doubleHiggsJetOptimisation}.
 % The selection efficiency of b-jets and c-jets with training samples is shown in \Figure{fig:doubleHiggs1.4Btag}.

\begin{comment}
Event shape variables are some useful global variables to describe the shape of the event, for example whether it is back-to-back, or homogenous in the solid angle.

The classical event shape thrust\cite{PhysRevLett.39.1587}, is defined as
\begin{equation}
T = \max_{\hat{t}}\!\frac{\sum_{i}\absOf{\hat{t}\!\cdot\!\vec{p_{i}}}}{\sum_{i}\absOf{\vec{p_{i}}}}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{p_{i}}$ is the momentum vector of the particle $i$. Summation is over all particles in the event. Thrust axis, $\hat{t}$, is a unit vector. (Principle) Thrust value, $T$, is 1 for a perfect pencillike back-to-back two-jet event, and 0.5 for a perfect spherical event. The thrust value is useful in picking out back-to-back two-jet event. Thrust axis is useful to separate each jet in a back-to-back two-jet event.
\end{comment}
\begin{comment}
A related variable , sphericity is  derived from the sphericity tensor \cite{PhysRevLett.35.1609}. The sphericity tensor is  defined as
\begin{equation}
\bm{S^{\alpha\beta}} = \frac{\sum_{i}p^{\alpha}_{i}p^{\beta}_{i}}{\sum_{i}\absOf{\vec{p_{i}}}^2},
\end{equation}
where $\vec{p_{i}}$ is the momentum vector of the particle $i$. Summation is over all particles in the event. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ refer to the x, y, z coordinate axis. Eigenvalues of tensor $\bm{S}$ can be found, or in this case diagonalisation of the matrix $\bm{S}$, denoted with $\lambda_{1}$, $\lambda_{2}$, $\lambda_{3}$. The normalisation condition requires $\lambda_{1}\!\geqslant\! \lambda_{2} \! \geqslant \! \lambda_{3}$ and $ \lambda_{1} \! + \! \lambda_{2} \! + \! \lambda_{3} \! = \! 1 $. Sphericity, $S$, is defined in terms of $\lambda$,
\begin{equation}
\sphericity = \frac{3}{2}\parenths{\lambda_{1} \! + \! \lambda_{2}}.
\end{equation}
\sphericity, is 0 for a perfect pencil-like back-to-back two-jet event, and 1 for a perfect spherically symmetric event.

Aplanarity is another useful event shape variable that distinguishes spherical symmetrical events from planar and linear events. The definition is
\begin{equation}
S = \frac{3}{2}\parenths{\lambda_{1}},
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_{1}$ is the largest eigenvalue in the diagonalised sphericity tensor, $\bm{S^{\alpha\beta}}$.



\section{Miscellaneous}

An event in a collider experiment refers to one collision and the subsequent energy deposition in the detector. An event corresponds to a certain type of physics process.

Often we are dealing with extracting a type of events, from a large number of other events. The signal, or signal events refer to events of interests. Other events are referred to as the background, or background events.

Typical metrics of signal selection is efficiency and purity. This toy example illustrates definitions of efficiency and purity.

Signal selection efficiency is defined as $\frac{N_S}{N_S \! + \! N_2}$. Signal selection purity is defined as $\frac{N_S}{N_S \! + \! N_1}$.
Significance is a quantity that is similar to purity, $\frac{N_S}{\rootOf{N_S \! + \! N_1}}$

When we are describing particles, light lepton, \llight, refer to electrons, \Pem, and muons, \Pmuon. Light quarks, \qlight, refer to up quark, \Pup, down quark, \Pdown, and strange quark, \Pstrange.

\section{Multivariate Analysis}
\label{sec:pandoraMVA}

Multivariate analysis (MVA) has become increasingly common in high energy physics. MVA is typically used as the last step of the physics analysis to select signal from background. It can be viewed as an advanced tool for regression or classification. Comparing to the traditional cut based method, modern machine learning technique offers much improvement in data analysis. Software package for MVA used throughout this document is TMVA \cite{Hocker:2007ht}.

A typical machine learning MVA classification involves two classes, also known as signal and background. A machine learning model, also known as a classifier in TMVA, needs to be trained with training data. The model requires a set of discriminative variables, which separate the signal from background. The trained model will be applied onto the testing data for signal extraction. Response of the model could be a classification of signal or background, or could  a response in a continuous spectrum, where the user decides the value to separate signal from background.

Strictly, there should be three statistically independent samples for the MVA. One sample is for the training. Another sample for the validation, including optimisation and checking for overfitting. The last sample is for testing. However, due to technical reason (TMVA only natively supports two samples), sometimes the same sample is used for the validation and the testing, which is acceptable with large statistics.

This classification scheme can be easily extended to multiple classes, implemented in TMVA with multiclass class. The multiclass class is used in the tau decay mode classification in \Section{} and in the flavour tagging classifier in \Section{sec:pandoraLCFI}.

\subsection{Optimisation and overfitting}
\label{sec:pandoraMVAoptimisation}

The optimisation of the model refers to selecting the optimal free parameters of the model. One could build a complex model which fits the training samples very well, but it would not be optimal for another testing sample. A simple model is less prone to statistical fluctuation of samples, however, it might be too simple to achieve the optimal modeling. The former case is known as overfitting, or overtraining. The latter case is called underfitting, or undertraining.

The compromise is clear. The optimal model is the one between overfitting and underfitting. In practice, this involves building the model with increasing complexity, and finding the point where overfitting occurs.

\begin{figure}[!tbp]
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{doubleHiggs/DepthOfTrees.pdf}
\caption{Example of model efficiency as a complexity of model parameter. Here the model is boosted decision tree. The model parameter is depth of tree. From tree depth 6 onwards, overfitting occurs.}
\label{fig:doubleHiggsMVAovertraining}
\end{figure}

\FIGURE{fig:doubleHiggsMVAovertraining} shows a typical overfitting plot. Overfitting is defined when the efficiency of signal selection in the training samples increases, but the efficiency in the testing sample decreases. The example in \Figure{fig:doubleHiggsMVAovertraining}  is chosen from double Higgs analysis at \rootS{3}, using Boosted Decision Tree model. The efficiency of signal selection is defined as the signal fraction when background fraction is 1\%, report by the TMVA training process. In \Figure{fig:doubleHiggsMVAovertraining} , the depth of the tree, or the number of layers in the tree, reflects the complexity of the model. From tree depth 2 to 5, the efficiency for both testing and training samples increases. From tree depth 6 onwards, the overfitting occurs. In this particular example, one should choose a tree depth fewer than 7 to avoid overfitting.

\FIGURE{fig:doubleHiggsMVAovertraining}  can be repeated with different split of training and testing samples to avoid the statistical fluctuation in samples. This allows a better estimation of where overfitting occurs. However this method is not used as the TMVA does not support such a method.

   %There are better methods
%There are methods to assign the error on the selection efficiency, as the training and testing efficiency would fluctuate wit . Thus one can make a better choice of parameters to avoid overfitting. These methods were not implemented due to the technical capacity provided by the TMVA.


\subsection{Choice of models}

The model, also known as the classifier in TMVA, can be as simple as cut based, likelihood or linear regression. It can also be as complicated as non linear tree, non linear neutral network or support vector machine. Regardless of model complexity, the choice of most optimal classifier is often data driven. Also, given the free parameters in each model, the comparison between different models without individual tuning is not rigourous. Nevertheless, as researchers in the machine learning suggested, the boosted decision tree is probably the best out-of-the-box machine learning method. Neutral network could potentially be better than the boosted decision, but it requires more tuning, and it is less intuitive to interpret the model. For these reasons, boost decision tree (BDT) is often the choice of machine learning model in the high energy physics. And it is used in various physics analysis in this document.

Before describing BDT in detail, we will first visit some simple models.

%the traditional rectangular cut model, and the Projective Likelihood method, which is used in the photon ID in the \pandora in \Section{}.

\subsubsection{Rectangular Cut}

Probably the most intuitive model, the rectangular cut method optimise cuts to maximise some specific metric. The metric could be the signal efficiency for a particular background efficiency. Alternatively, the metric can be the significance, $\frac{S}{\rootOf{S\!+\!B}}$, where $S$ and $B$ are signal and background numbers, respectively.

Discriminative variables gives better separation power when they are gaussian-like and statistically independent. Therefore it is common to decoorelate  the variables and gaussian transform them before using the rectangular cut MVA.

Because its simplicity, the cut method is often performed manually, much more often in the time pre-date the wide spread of machine learning methods. It is still commonly used for the pre-selection step before the MVA (see \Section{sec:doubleHiggsPreSelection}), and other simple cases. Unless specified, the optimal cuts proposed in this document for various physics analysis are found using the rectangular cut method manually.

\subsubsection{Projective Likelihood}
\label{sec:pandoraLikelihood}

Projective likelihood model with probability density estimators (PDE) is used in \pandora for the photon ID  due to its simplicity and low requirement on computing resources. The \pandora implementation is discussed  in \Section{sec:photonPDE}.
%Probability density estimators for each input variable combined in likelihood estimator (ignoring correlations

Likelihood classifier implemented in the TMVA calculates the probability density for each discriminative variable, for signal and background (hence PDE approach). The overall signal and background likelihood are defined as products of the individual probability density. The likelihood ratio, $R$, is then defined as the signal likelihood over signal plus background likelihood. TMVA implementation also fits an underlying function to the probability density.

%The \pandora implementation simply uses binned likelihood ratio, $R$, as the output, due to the simplicity. The sub-categories for the \pandora implementation are determined by the cluster energy.

Similarly to the rectangular cut method, PDE works better with decorrelated, gaussian like variables.

%The \pandora implementation did not decorrelate nor transform the variables, to keep implementation fast.


\subsubsection{Decision tree}
\label{sec:pandoraDecisionTree}
 %is a non linear tree based model

Before discussing Boost decision tree (BDT), it is necessary to introduce Decision tree. Decision tree is a non linear tree based model. Its rather complex nature requires a careful explanation of many concepts.

Decision tree is a binary tree, where each node, the splitting point, uses a single discriminative variable to decide whether a event is signal-like (``goes down by a layer to the left''), or background-like (``goes down by a layer to the right''). At each node, samples are divided into signal-like and background-like sub-samples. The tree growing starts at the root node, and stops at certain criterion, which could be the minimum number of events in a node, the number of layers of the tree, or a minimum/maximum signal purity.

The training of the decision tree is to determine the optimal cut at the node by minimising the metric. The probability of the cut producing the signal is $p$. Three commonly used metrics for two-class classification are
\begin{enumerate}
\item Misclassification error:  $1 - \max\parenths{p\!,\!1\!-\!p}$,
\item Gini index: $2p\parenths{1\!-\!p}$,
\item Cross-Entropy or deviance: $-p\log{p}-\parenths{1\!-\!p}\log\parenths{1\!-\!p}$.
\end{enumerate}

The using of a trained decision tree is to transverse along the tree. The event is classified as signal or background depending on whether it falls in the signal-like or background-like end node.

\begin{figure}[!tbp]
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{doubleHiggs/mva/BDTcomic}
\caption[Example of a decision tree. ]
{Example of a decision tree. Numbers in each node represent number of PhD student (red) and number of undergraduate student (blue) after each cut.}
   \label{fig:doubleHiggsMVAdecisionTree}
\end{figure}

\FIGURE{fig:doubleHiggsMVAdecisionTree} illustrate a simple example of a decision tree. The signal is the PhD student and the background is the undergraduate student. The depth of this imbalance binary  tree is 2. A node is represented by a diamond.  The signal-like node is the red rectangle and the background-like nodes are blue rectangles. The tree is constructed with two possible cut, ``Party ends before 1am'' and ``Know where free pizza is''. The attribute of samples is listed in \Table{tab:doubleHiggsDecisionTreeComic}. To demonstrate the choice of the first layer cut, the Gini index metric is used. If the first cut is ``Party ends before 1am'', the probability of the cut producing the signal, $p$, is $\frac{10}{13}$. Gini index is $2p\parenths{1\!-\!p} \backsimeq 0.36 $. If the first cut is ``Know where free pizza is'', $p=\frac{10}{15}$. Gini index is $2p\parenths{1\!-\!p} \backsimeq 0.44 $. Therefore, the first cut is ``Party ends before 1am''.

The simple tree in \Figure{fig:doubleHiggsMVAdecisionTree} is grown fully as each end node contains signal or background only. To use the trained decision tree, if there is student who ends party before 1am and knows where free pizza is, then the student is classified as a PhD student.

\begin{table}[!tbp]\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline \hline
Number & Party ends before 1am  & Know where free pizza is\\
\hline
PhD student & 10 & 10 \\
Undergrad student & 3 & 5 \\
\hline \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption
{The attribute of samples for the decision tree example.}

\end{table}

\paragraph{Improve decision tree}

Decision tree has a low bias, but high variance. This means it is very easy to construct a tree, which is also the best tree, that fits the training data very well, but the tree would not be optimal for the testing sample. To overcome the instability of the decision tree, many methods have been developed. The most successful one is boosting and bagging.

Boosting: it is a technique where the misclassified events receives a higher weight than the correctly classified events. Therefore, when the training is iterated, the misclassified events would receive higher and higher wights and more likely to classify correctly. The boosting is done at every iteration, which can be few hundred or few thousand time. This will create a ``forest'' of many trees. The final output could be a majority vote, by transversing the event to the end node for each tree in the forest.

Bagging: also known as boot-strap, it is a method that select a simple random sub-set of the training sample, and apply the model. In this case, every boosting iteration takes a bagged sample, rather than the whole sample.

\subsubsection{Boosted decision tree}
\label{sec:analysisBDT}

Boosted decision tree (BDT) contains a forest of decision trees , where each tree is iterated many times using a technique called boosting.   By overcoming the instability of a single  decision tree, BDT is often regards as  the best out-of-the-box machine learning method. There are two common boosting methods: adaptive boosting and gradient boosting. First introduced in \cite{FREUND1997119}, the adaptive boosting is discussed in further details, as it is simpler to understand than gradient boosting.

The basic idea of the adaptive boosting is such that the tree making procedure focuses on events which are difficult to classify correctly. By assigning a weight to each event,   after each tree making iteration, the weights for misclassified events are gradually increased. Therefore misclassified events gets more attention.

A simple example is provided. Assuming tree classifier output is -1 or 1. One can think of -1 is background and 1 is signal. Suppose there are $N$ events and $M$ iterations (trees). For $i^{th}$ event in $m^{th}$ tree,  $B_{i,m} = 1$ if the event is misclassified, 0 otherwise.

The adaptive boosting algorithm, adapted from \cite{hastie2009elements},  is outlined below.

\begin{itemize}
  \item For $N$ events, event weight is $w = 1 / N$ for every event.
  \item Iterate for $M$ times. M is the total number of trees. For iteration $m$:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Create a $m^{th}$ tree  with weighted samples.
      \item Update $m^{th}$ tree error function, $err_m = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N} w_{i,m-1} B_{i,m} }{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}w_{i,m-1}}$.
      %, where $B_{i,m} = 1$ if $i^{th}$ event is misclassified, 0 if $i^{th}$ event is correctly classified. $w_{i,m-1}$ is the event weight for $i^th$ event generated in previous iteration.
      \item Update $m^{th}$ tree weight,  $\alpha_m = \log\parenths{\frac{1 - err_m}{err_m}}$
      \item Update $i^{th}$ event weight, $w_{i,m} = w_{i,m-1} e^{\alpha_m B_{i,m} }$.
    \end{itemize}
  \item The output $G(x)$ for testing event $x$ is a weighted vote from all M trees:
  \begin{equation}
    G(x)=
     \begin{cases}
      -1, & \mbox{if} \sum_{m=1}^{M}\alpha_mG_m(x) < 0 , \\
      1, & \mbox{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

In each iteration, if the $i^{th}$ event is misclassified, the weight increases by a factor of $(1 - err_m)/(err_m)$. Otherwise, the event weight does not change.

The power of the ablative boosting to dramatically improve the performance of a weak classifier. A weak classifier is a classifier is sightly better than random guessing. A small decision tree would be a weak classifier. By sequentially applying many weak classifier with weighted samples, the final ``forest'' is very robust with very good performance.

%A weak classifier is one whose error rate is only slightly better than random guessing. The purpose of boosting is to sequentially apply the weak classification algorithm to repeatedly modified versions of the data,

TMVA implementation of the BDT for the output is using a likelihood estimator, depending on how often a event is classified as signal in the forest. The likelihood number is later used to select signal from background.

\paragraph{Optimisation of Boosted Decision Tree}
\label{sec:pandoraMVAbdtVar}
Many parameters of the BDT can be tuned. The tuned parameters are described below.

The most important parameter is the depth of a tree, which determines how many end nodes a tree has, or the degrees of freedom of a tree. The related parameter is the number of trees. Experience shows that using many small trees yields the best result. The performance as a function of the depth is shown in \Figure{fig:doubleHiggsMVAovertraining}.

The number of tree is another important parameter. Intuitively large number of trees leads to overfitting. However, it has been shown that a large number does not lead to overfitting, using the definition above. Therefore there is a debate on the metric to determine the optimal number of tree.

The minimum number of events in a node, which is a stopping criteria for tree growing, affects the size of the tree. But it is less influential than the depth of the tree.

The boosting has two variant in TMVA implementation, adaptive boost and gradient boost.

The learning rate of the adaptive boost, which controls how fast the weight changes for events in each boosting iteration. Experience shows small learning rate with many trees work better than large learning rate with few trees.

The shrinkage rate of the gradient boost is similar to the learning rate of the adaptive. It controls how fast the weight changes for events in each boosting iteration. Again a small value is preferable.

The usual choice of the metric for the optimal cuts is either Gini index or cross-entropy. Typically Gini index metric is chosen. It makes little difference to performances, comparing to the cross-entropy metric.

Number of bins per variables for the cut is necessary to make tree growing efficient. Discrete binned variables are faster to computer than continuous variables. The parameter does not impact the performance much. However, variables should be pre-processed before going into the model. For example, the variable should be limited to a sensible range to avoid the extremes. The variable should also be transformed to obtain a more uniform distribution, if the original distribution is highly skewed.

For the end node, it is determined as either signal-like or background-like, based on the majority for the training event in the end node. Numerically, it corresponds to 1/0. However, the end node could also use signal purity as the output, resulting in a continues spectrum of [0,1]. The adaptive boosting algorithm is modified for the output value continues spectrum.

Bagging fraction determines the fraction of randomly selected samples used in each boosting iteration. By choosing a smaller value, samples between each boosting iteration are less correlated. Hence the overall performance improves.

DoPreSelection flag allows the classifier to throw away phases spaces where there is only background events.

\subsection{Multiple classes}
\label{sec:pandoraMVAmulticlass}
% ATTN used in tau chapter

The above discussion is done assuming two classes - signal and background. The argument can be easily extended to multiple classes. There are two ways for the training. ``One v.s. one'' is each class is trained against each other class. And the overall likelihood is normalised. The second way to train is called ``one v.s. all'', which is when each class is trained against all other classes.

Using a three-class example, A, B and C, ``one v.s. one" scheme trains A against B, B against C, and C against A. Then the likelihood is normalised. ``One v.s. all" would train A against B plus C, B against A plus C, and C against A plus B.

TMVA multiclass implementation uses ``one v.s. all" scheme. For each class, the multiclass classifier will train the class as the signal against all other final states as the background. This process is repeated for each class. The classifier output for a single event is a normalised response using all trained classifier, where the sum is one. The response of each class in a event can be treated as the likelihood. In the classicisation stage, The event is classified into a particular class if that class has the highest classifier output response.

The advantage of using the multiclass is that the correlation between different classes are accounted for and the classifier output are correctly adjusted for multiple class. Hence one event can only be classified into one final state. The issue with the multiclass is that discriminative variables all classes need enter the training stage, resulting in a large number of variables.

TMVA multiclass implementation uses "one v.s. all" scheme. Multiclass is used in flavour tagging of jets, \Section{sec:pandoraLCFI}, and in the tau lepton final state separation study, \Section{}.
