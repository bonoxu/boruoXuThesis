{A wise Chinese}%: Blackwood's Magazine May 1830

%As previously stated, this document focus on the \ILD and \CLICILD detectors. Due to the similarity, we often only discuss one detector to avoid the repetition. The difference in detectors will be stated if applicable.

In previous chapters, overviews of the theory and the future linear collider experiments have been described. Since the work presented in this document is for future collider, simulation and monte carlo method is used throughout the document. In this chapter, the simulation and event reconstruction chain are discussed, with emphasis on the \pandora event reconstrcution, which provides the background for the photon reconstruction algorithms in \Chapter{chap:Reconstruction}.

Simulation and reconstruction of events for the future Linear Colliders, \ILC and \CLIC, share common software framework. The noticeable difference will be discussed.

\section{Monte Carlo event generation}

For the simulated study, Monte Carlo (MC) event generation is the first step. Most events, electron-positron interaction, are generated with WHIZARD software, \cite{whizard,Moretti:2001zz}, with no polarisation of the electron and positrons. Some simple events are generated with HEPEVT. PYTHIA \cite{Sjostrand:1995iq} is used to describe parton showering, hadronisation and fragmentation. The parameters for PYTHIA are tuned to OPAL data from the LEP \cite{Alexander:1995bk}. TAUOLA \cite{Jadach:1993hs} debrides the tau lepton decay with correct spin correlations of the day products. The Initial State Radiation (\ISR) is simulated in WHIZARD with the \ISR photons being collinear with the beam direction. The Final State Radiation (\FSR) is simulated with default parameters in PYTHIA.

For the \CLIC simulated samples, the luminosity spectrum, which is generated with GUINEAPIG \cite{Schulte:1999tx}, is simulated in WHIZARD. The \ggHad background events are hadronised with PYTHIA, and superimposed on the physics process simulations to save computational resources.

\section{Event Simulation}

The event simulation software is GEANT4 \cite{Agostinelli:2002hh}, and the detector geometry description is provided by MOKKA \cite{MoradeFreitas:2002kj}.  QGSP\_BERT physics list is used to describe the hadronic showers decay in the detector.


%Simulation and reconstruction of events for the future Linear Colliders share common software framework. Simulated events are generated with Whizard software \cite{}. Pythia describes hadronisation and Tauola simulates correct spins of tau lepton decay products.  Whizard allows events simulation without initial state radiation, and can simulate electron beam interaction. For the \CLIC detector, electron beam induced background events are simulated and reconstructed. These events are superimposed on the physics process to save computational resources.


\section{Event Reconstruction}

Reconstruction software runs in Marlin framework \cite{Gaede:2006pj}, as a part of the \ilcsoft. Event reconstruction contains following steps: digitisation of simulated calorimeter hits, reconstruction of tracks in the tracking system using pattern recognition algorithms, and particle flow objects (\PFOs)reconstruction with \pandora\cite{Thomson:2009rp,Marshall:2012ry}. Reconstruction does not include calorimeters hits in the forward calorimeters, due to computational reasons  (see \Section{sec:doubleHiggsForwardElectron}).

For the \CLIC detector simulations, suppression of \ggHad background is performed.

Details of the reconstruction can be found in \cite{Brau:2007zza,Linssen:2012hp}. Particle flow reconstruction via \pandora will be discussed in details, which provides the background for the photon reconstructions in \pandora in \Chapter{chap:Reconstruction}.



\section{\pandora}
\label{sec:pandoraPandoraPFA}
Tradition calorimetric approach is unable to meet the mass and energy requirements for the future linear collider. The particle flow approach with \pandora has a proof-of-principle demonstration of its capability to reach required resolution. The particle flow approach also put stringent requirements on the detector design, which is described in \Chapter{chap:Detector}. By associating calorimeter hits to the tracks, around 60\% of the jet energy from charged particles is measured by the tracker, which has a much better resolution than the calorimeter. Small cell sizes of the calorimeters are required to identify hits from different particles. The traditional sum of calorimeter cell energies is replaced by particle flow reconstruction algorithms, a complex pattern recognition problem.  The \pandora algorithm has been developed and used in the \ILC and \CLIC simulation studies.

Started with the \ILD detector concept, \pandora has been adapted to the \CLIC condition and shows its ability to deliver required energy resolutions \cite{Linssen:2012hp}. Recent the code base of the \pandora has been restructured. The core base codes for basic object and memory managements are factorised in the Pandora C++ Software Development Kit\cite{Marshall:2015rfa}. There are over 60 linear collider specific reconstruction algorithms, each aims to address a particular topological in the reconstruction.

In the subsequent paragraphs, the main steps in the \pandora reconstructions are described. The details of the reconstruction can be found in cite{Thomson:2009rp,Marshall:2012ry,Marshall:2015rfa}.

Inputs of \pandora are digitised calorimeter hits and reconstructed tracks. The output are reconstructed particles with four-momenta, Particle Flow Objects (\PFOs).

\subsection{Track selection}
\label{sec:pandoraPandoraTrack}
Tracks from the tracking system are selected based on their topological properties, how likely they are from physical processes, and whether they are consistent with the tracker resolution. Tracks passed the selection are used for the subsequent reconstruction.  Special topologies of tracks are identified, such as when a neutral particle decays or converts into a pair of charged tracks, leaving a ``V0''  shape tracks. This is identified by searching for a pair of tracks originated from a single point. Another topologies include ``kinks'' , when a charged particle decays to a single charged particles with neutral particles, and ``prongs'', when a charged particles decays to multiple charged particles. This information are stored and passed on to the subsequent reconstruction, along side with the helical track fit (using last 50 reconstructed hits) and the track projection to the front of the \ECAL.

\subsection{Calorimeter selection}

The input information of a calorimeter hit is the position, the layer in the calorimeter and the energy response from the calorimeter.

Calorimeter hits are selected based on a series of criterion. The selected hits need to have energies above the threshold, using the conversion of a minimum ionising particle (MIP) equivalent, and using directly the converted energy. Similar to tracks, only calorimeter passed the selection are used in later steps.

Geometry information and likelihood of the hit originated from a minimum ionising particle (MIP) are calculated.

Isolated hits, often originated from low energy neutrons in a hadronic shower, are difficult to associate to the correct hadronic shower. They are identified and not used in the clustering. But their energy is added in the very last particle flow object (PFO) creation step.

\subsection{Cone Clusters Algorithm}
\label{sec:pandoraConeCluster}
Before discussing the rest of the \pandora reconstruction, it is necessary to introduce the cone based clustering algorithm, which is widely used in the calorimeter in \pandora. The clustering algorithm produces basic working objects, \clusters.


\begin{figure}[tbph]
\centering
{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{pandora/coneClustering}}%
\caption{Illustration of the cone clustering algorithm, taken from \cite{Marshall:pandoraLC}}
\label{fig:pandoraConeClustering}
\end{figure}

There are two main types of clustering algorithms: cone based and sequential combination (see \Section{}). The main clustering scheme \pandora is cone clustering, for grouping calorimeter hits. Illustrated in \Figure{fig:pandoraConeClustering}, cone clustering has a specified opening angle of the seed hit. Because the direction of particle flows is largely unchanged from the originated particle, whether it is a electromagnetic shower, QCD radiation or hadronisation, these cone clusters have similar direction and energy to the originated particle. Therefore it is applicable to use cone based clustering algorithms for building clusters.

The seed for the cone clustering is typically the projection of a energetic track to the front of the \ECAL. A high  energy calorimeter hit can also be used as a seed. A cone with a specified opening angle and depth will be formed around the seed. The \fourMomentum of calorimeter hits sum to the cone's \fourMomentum.

Build from inner to outer, then every layer outer in inner see Mark's paper

\subsection{Particle Identification}
\label{sec:particleID}

Dedicated particle identification algorithms aim to identify muons and photons before associating calorimeter hits to tracks. The details of the photon reconstruction algorithms and photon related algorithms are described in \Chapter{chap:Reconstruction}. By removing the hits from muons and photons, the reconstruction of charged particles is improved as it reduce the pattern recognition problem. Identified muons and photons do not participate in the clustering and re-clustering stages, but re-entre the construction at the fragment removal stage (see \Section{sec:pandoraFragmentRemoval}).

\subsection{Clustering}

The cone clustering algorithm described in \Section{sec:pandoraConeCluster} is used to group calorimeter hits from innermost to outmost pseduo-layer. The output \clusters are further processed, merged or split based on their topological properties.

\subsection{Topological cluster association}

Initial clustering scheme is aggressive at splitting clusters. Small clusters are merged  based on clear topological signatures. These merging signatures include combining track segments, connecting tack segments with gaps, connecting track segment to a hadronic shower, and merging clusters when they are within close proximity.

\subsection{Track-cluster association}

Clusters are associated to tracks, according to the proximity of the first layer of the cluster and the track projection to the front of the \ECAL.


\subsection{Re-clustering}

The cluster association scheme work well for low energy (less than 50\,GeV) jet. For a high energy jet, particles and the subsequent hadronic showers are more boosted and more likely to overlap each other. Therefore, it is important to re-cluster based on the compatibility of the cluster energy and the associated track momentum. A cluster may be split into two. Two clusters maybe be re-clustered based on the track-cluster association. The re-clustering algorithm is applied iteratively to find a more correct clustering of calorimeter hits.

\begin{comment}
\subsection{Photon identification}

The neutral clusters are tested against an expected photon electromagnetic shower profile. The longitudinal shower profile for a photon cluster is required to be similar to a expected electromagnetic shower profile, with the discrepancy being smaller than a threshold.
\end{comment}

\subsection{Fragment removal}
\label{sec:pandoraFragmentRemoval}
The late stage of the reconstruction will focus on merging low energy clusters, especially non-photon neutral clusters. These neutral clusters are likely to be fragments of charged clusters, instead of being a physical particle. The merging criterion are mostly based on the proximity and the energy comparison.

One algorithm will attempt to split up photon clusters, where each is originated from two close by photons. Photon related algorithms are described in details in \Chapter{chap:Reconstruction}.



\subsection{Particle Flow Object Creation}
\label{sec:pandoraPFOcreation}

% double counting taking care in pandora
Particle Flow Objects (PFOs) are created at the last step. Tracks are associated to the clusters based on the proximity. Simple but effective particle identification for electrons, muons are applied. Photon identifications have been applied at various stages of the reconstruction.

PFOs are the output of the \pandora reconstruction. The four-momentum of these PFOs are  used heavily for the downstream analysis. The electron, muon and photon identification are  also used in physics analysis, such as one described in \Chapter{chap:Tau}.

\section{Suppression of \ggHad backgrounds}
\label{sec:pandoraggHad}


For the CLIC, significant \ggHad background is present. It is crucial to remove the beam induced background as they don't represent the underlying physics process.

Two Marlin process has been developed to suppress these background, a track selector and a PFO selector\cite{Marshall:2012ry}.

The track selector aims to remove poor quality and fake tracks. It places simple quality cut and a simple time of arrival cut. If the arrival time of the track at the front of the \ECAL, using the helical fit, differs more than 50\,ns from using a straight line fit, the track will be rejected.

The PFO selector utilise the high spatial resolution from the high granular calorimeter. PFOs from \ggHad often have low \pT and have a range of time. PFOs from physics processes have a range of \pT, and have time close to the brunch crossing time. These two distinctive features allow \ggHad background to be separated. The optimal suppression uses different \pT and time cuts for the central part of the detector, and for the forward part of the detector, and uses different cuts for photons, neutral PFOs and charged PFOs. Three configurations of these cuts are developed, namely ``loose'', ``normal'', and ``tight'' selections. As the name suggested, ``loose'' selection corresponds to a looser cut of \pT and time. The optimal configuration depends on the \sqrtS of the collision, and the physics process to study.

The background suppression is used in analysis described in \Chapter{chap:DoubleHiggs}

\section{Reconstruction Processors}

Automated analysis is the only way to deal with the vast amount of data generated in the high energy physics. In the last chapter we described the automated reconstruction tools in details. This chapter is dedicated to the common automated analysis tools and techniques, which will be used in the analysis described in subsequent chapters.

For the linear collider, thanks to the high granular calorimeter, the starting point for analysis would be individual Particle Flow Objects, as well as individual tracks. Each of the PFOs encodes four-momentum and position information. For tracks, they would have momentum and position information.

However, sometimes it is interesting to group PFOs and tracks into jets, where a jet is the result of hadronisation process from high energy particles like quarks or gulons.

\section{Jet algorithm}

A jet is typically a visually obvious structure in a event display. The momentum and the direction of a jet tend to resemble the originated particle. Despite the relative easiness of identifying jets visually, it presents a challenge for a pattern recognition program to identify jets effectively and efficiently.

Early work on jet finding started in 1977 \cite{Sterman:1977wj}, where later development can be found in reviews \cite{Moretti:1998qx,Salam:2009jx,Ali:2010tw}.

There are two large families of jet finding algorithm, cone based algorithms, and sequential combination algorithms. Cone based algorithm is briefly discussed in \Section{sec:pandoraConeClustering} in the context of the \pandora user case.

Sequential combination algorithms typically calculate a pair-wise distance metric. Pairs with the smallest metric will be combined. The metric will be calculated and updated after a combination. This procedure will be repeated until some stopping criterion are satisfied.
%, and a pair with smallest metric will be combined.

The chosen jet algorithm implementation is FastJet C++ software package \cite{Cacciari:2011ma,Cacciari:2005hq}, providing a wide range of jet finding algorithms. The implementation in Marlin software package is called MarlinFastJet. The symbols in the subsequent discussion follow the convention in \cite{Cacciari:2011ma}
\paragraph{\kt algorithm}

longitudinally-invariant \kt algorithm \cite{Catani:1993hr,Ellis:1993tq} is one of the common sequential combination algorithms for \pp collider experiment. In the inclusive variant, the symmetrical pair-wise distance metric between particle $i$ and $j$, and the beam distance, are defined as
\begin{equation}
&d_{ij} = d_{ji} = \min\!\parenths{\pT_{i}^{2},\!\pT_{j}^{2}}\frac{\DeltaOf{R_{ij}^{2}}}{R^{2}}, \\
&d_{iB} = \pT_{i}^2,
\end{equation}
where $\pT_{i}$ is the transverse momentum of particle $i$ with respect to the beam ($z$) direction, and $\DeltaOf{R_{ij}^{2}}$ is the measurement of angular separation of particle $i$ and $j$, defined as $\DeltaOf{R_{ij}^{2}} = \parenths{y_i - y_j}^2 + \parenths{\phi_i - \phi_j}^2$, where $y_i = \frac{1}{2}\ln\!\frac{E_i + {p_z}_i}{E_i - {p_z}_i}$ and $\phi_i$ are particle $i$'s rapidity and azimuthal angle. $R$ is a free parameter controlling the jet radius.

If $d_{ij} < d_{iB}$, particle $i$ and $j$ are merged, with the \fourMomentum of particle $i$ updated as the sum of the two particles. Otherwise, particle $i$ is set to be a final jet, and deleted from the particle list. The above procedure is repeated until no particle left.

The exclusive variant is similar. First difference is that when  $d_{iB} < d_{ij}$, the particle $i$ is discarded and part of the beam jet. The second difference is that when both $d_{ij}$ and $d_{iB}$ are above some threshold, $d_{cut}$, the clustering will stop. In practise, exclusive mode allows a specified number of jets to be found, which will automatically choose the $d_{cut}$. The inclusive mode would find as many jets as the algorithm allows.



\subsection{Durham algorithm}

Durham algorithm \cite{Catani:1991hj}, also known as \ee \kt algorithm, is commonly used \ee collider experiment. It has a single distance metric:
\begin{equation}
d_{ij} = 2\min\!\parenths{E_i^2,\!E_j^2}\!\parenths{1 - \cosOf{\theta_{ij}}},
\end{equation}
where $E_i$ is the energy of particle $i$. $\theta_{ij}$ is the polar angle difference between particle $i$ and $j$. Durham algorithm can only be run at exclusive mode, which means that the clustering will stop when $d_{ij}$ is above some threshold, $d_{cut}$.

Comparing to \kt algorithm, it uses energy instead of \pT in the distance metric, and it did not have a beam jet. This is because that for the \ee collider in the past, the beam induced background was not severe and collisions energy is known, \sqrtS.

\paragraph{Jet algorithm for the \CLIC}

Although \CLIC is a \ee collider, the significant beam-induced background adds a large amount of energy from \ggHad process (see \Section{}). Therefore, traditional \ee jet algorithms, like Durham algorithm (see \Section{}), is not suitable for the \CLIC environment. Studies has shown that jet algorithms for \pp collider have better performance \cite{Linssen:2012hp,LCD-Note-2010-006}.

A more recent attempt at marrying merits from both Durham and \kt algorithms has resulted in Valencia jet algorithm \cite{Boronat:2014hva}. It had shown promising improvement comparing to \kt algorithm, which is used in the parallel  \eeToHHbbbb  sub-channel analysis.

\subsection{\y{} parameter}
A commonly used variable for number of jets is the \y{} parameter. \y{} parameter describes the transition of exclusive jet algorithm going from $N$ clustered jets to $N\!+\!1$ clustered jets. For example, $\y{23}$ would be the $d_{cut}$ value for a exclusive jet algorithm, above which the jet algorithm returns 2 jets, below which the jet algorithm returns 3 jets (see \Section{sec:doubleHiggsJetAlgorithm} for jet algorithm). Numerically \y{} parameter is often much smaller than one. A typically way to convert the small number to a human acceptable range is to take the minus logarithm of the number.


\subsection{\lcfiplus}

The \lcfiplus software package is based on the LCFIVertex package, which was used in the simulation studies for \ILCloi \cite{Abe:2010aa,Aihara:2009ad} and \CLICcdr \cite{Linssen:2012hp}. Current software is built in mind of a future \ee collider. Although the software is modular and can be used in any order, here it will be described in the order used in a physics analysis.

The input are \PFOs. The vertex finding algorithms perform vertex fitting and identify primary and secondary vertex. There is a ``V0'' particle rejection step, which is neutral particles decaying or converting into a pair of charged tracks. The topology is similar to the decay of \Pbottom or \Pcharm hadrons. Hence it is important to remove the V0 particles to improve the heavy quark flavour tagging (see \Section{sec:pandoraPandoraTrack} for a similar V0 rejection).

Once the primary and secondary vertices are found, \PFOs are clustered in to jets. This jet clustering scheme ensures that the secondary vertices and the muons identified from semileptonic decay fall in the same jet. Therefore, it is consistent with the hadronic decay. Jet algorithms used are Durham and Durham modified algorithms(see \Section{}).

The next step is to refine vertices finding to improve the \Pbottom jet identification from \Pcharm jet. Since the existence of two close by vertices is strongly correlated to a \Pbottom jet, the vertices refining step will reconstruct as many secondary vertices correctly as possible.

The last step is to gather the information about vertices and jets, and deploy a multivariate analysis. The multivariate classier used, Boosted Decision Tree,  is implemented in TMVA software package \cite{Hocker:2007ht}, which is discussed later in \Section{}. A series of flavour sensitive variables are calculated, and the classification is divided into four subset: jet with zero, one, or two properly reconstructed vertices, or a single-track pseudovertex. For each subset, a jet can either be classified to a \Pbottom jet, a \Pcharm jet, or a light flavour quark jet (\Pup, \Pdown or \Pstrange). The multiclass classifier's response is normalised across different subset, and they will be referred in the subsequent physics analysis as the tag value. See \Section{} for a discussion on multiclass classifier.

The samples for training the multiclass classifier are \HepProcess{\Pep \Pem \to \PZ \APnu \Pnu} at \rootS{1.4}, where \PZ decays to \HepProcess{\Pbottom\APbottom}, \HepProcess{\Pcharm\APcharm}, or \HepProcess{\Pup\APup/\Pdown\APdown/\Pstrange\APstrange}.

The flavour tagging is performed after the initial jet reconstruction, and all the \PFOs in the reconstructed jets are the input to the \lcfiplus flavour tagging processor. Therefore, the classifier in the \lcfiplus processor is trained for a specific \PFO collection and a specific jet reconstruction algorithm. In this analysis, the classifier is trained with the optimal jet reinstruction choice, discussed in \Section{sec:doubleHiggsJetOptimisation}. The output of the processor for a jet is three values, corresponding to the likelihood of the jet being a \Pbottom jet, a \Pcharm jet, or a light flavour quark jet.  The selection efficiency of b-jets and c-jets with training samples is shown in \Figure{fig:doubleHiggs1.4Btag}.

\section{MVA}
Multivariate analysis  has become increasingly common in high energy physics. MVA can be viewed as an advanced tool for regression or classification. Comparing to the traditional cut based method, modern machine learning technique offers much improvement in data analysis. Software package for MVA used throughout this document is TMVA \cite{Hocker:2007ht}.

A typical machine learning MVA classification involves two classes, also known as signal and background. A machine learning model, also known as a classifier in TMVA, needs to be trained with training data. The model requires a set of discriminative variables, which separate the signal from background. The trained model will be applied onto the testing data for signal extraction. Response of the model could be a classification of signal or background, or could  a response in a continuous spectrum, where the user decides the value to separate signal from background.

Strictly, there should be three statistically independent samples for the MVA. One sample is for the training. Another sample for the validation, including optimisation and checking for overfitting. The last sample is for testing. However, due to technical reason (TMVA only natively supports two samples), sometimes the same sample is used for the validation and the testing, which is acceptable with large statistics.

This classification scheme can be easily extended to multiple classes, implemented in TMVA with multiclass class. The multiclass class is used in the tau decay mode classification in \Section{} and in the flavour tagging classifier in \Section{sec:doubleHiggsFlavourTagging}.

\subsection{Optimisation and overfitting}

The optimisation of the model refers to selecting the optimal free parameters of the model. One could build a complex model which fits the training samples very well, but it would not be optimal for another testing sample. A simple model is less prone to statistical fluctuation of samples, however, it might be too simple to achieve the optimal modeling. The former case is known as overfitting, or overtraining. The latter case is called underfitting, or undertraining.

The compromise is clear. The optimal model is one between overfitting and underfitting. In practice, this involves building the model with increasing complexity, and finding the point where overfitting occurs.

\begin{figure}[!tbp]
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{doubleHiggs/DepthOfTrees.pdf}
\caption{Example of MVA overtraining}
\label{fig:doubleHiggsMVAovertraining}
\end{figure}

\FIGURE{fig:doubleHiggsMVAovertraining} shows a typical overfitting plot. Overfitting is defined when the efficiency of signal selection in the training samples increases, but the efficiency in the testing sample decreases. Here the example is chosen from double Higgs analysis at \rootS{3}, using Boosted Decision Tree model. The efficiency of signal selection is defined as the signal fraction when background fraction is 1\%, report by the TMVA training process. In \Figure{fig:doubleHiggsMVAovertraining} , the depth of the tree, or the number of layers in the tree, reflects the complexity of the model. From tree depth 2 to 5, the efficiency for both testing and training samples increases. From tree depth 6 onwards, the overfitting occurs. In this particular example, one should choose a tree depth fewer than 7 to avoid overfitting.

There are methods to assign the error on the selection efficiency. Thus one can make a better choice of parameters to avoid overfitting. These methods were not implemented due to the technical capacity provided by the TMVA.

\subsection{Choice of models}

The model, also known as the classifier in TMVA, can be as simple as cut based, likelihood or linear regression. It can also be as complicated as non linear tree, non linear neutral network or support vector machine. Regardless of model complexity, the choice of most optimal classifier is often data driven. Also, given the free parameters in each model, the comparison between different models without individual tuning is not rigourous. Nevertheless, as researchers in the machine learning suggested, the boosted decision tree is probably the best out-of-the-box machine learning method. Neutral network could potentially be better than the boosted decision, but it requires more tuning, and it is less intuitive to interpret the model. For these reasons, boost decision tree (BDT) is often the choice of machine learning model in the high energy physics. And it is used in various physics analysis in this document.

Before describing BDT in detail, we will first visit some simple models.

%the traditional rectangular cut model, and the Projective Likelihood method, which is used in the photon ID in the \pandora in \Section{}.



\subsubsection{Rectangular Cut}

Probably the most intuitive model, the rectangular cut method optimise cuts to maximise some specific metric. The metric could be the signal efficiency for a particular background efficiency. Alternatively, the metric can be the significance, $\frac{S}{\rootOf{S\!+\!B}}$, where $S$ and $B$ are signal and background numbers, respectively.

Discriminative variables gives better separation power when they are gaussian-like and statistically independent. Therefore it is common to decoorelate  the variables and gaussian transform them before using the rectangular cut MVA.

Because its simplicity, the cut method is often performed manually, much more often in the time pre-date the wide spread of machine learning methods. It is still commonly used for the pre-selection step before the MVA (see \Section{sec:doubleHiggsPreSelection}), and other simple cases. Unless specified, the optimal cuts proposed in this document for various physics analysis are found using the rectangular cut method manually.

\subsubsection{Projective Likelihood}

Projective likelihood model (PDE) is used in \pandora for the photon ID  due to its simplicity and low requirement on computing resources. It is discussed in details in \Section{sec:photonPDE}

\begin{comment}
\subsection{Projective Likelihood}

Projective likelihood model (PDE) is used in \pandora for the photon ID due to its simplicity and low requirement on computing resources.

PDE implemented in the TMVA calculates the probability density for each discriminative variable, for signal and background. The overall signal and background likelihood are defined as products of the individual probability density. The likelihood ratio, $R$, is then defined as the signal likelihood over signal plus background likelihood.

TMVA implementation also fits an underlying function to the probability density. The \pandora implementation simply uses binned likelihood ratio, $R$, as the output, due to the simplicity. The sub-categories for the \pandora implementation are determined by the cluster energy.

Similarly to the rectangular cut method, PDE works better with decorrelated, gaussian like variables. The \pandora implementation did not decorrelate nor transform the variables, to keep implementation fast.
\end{comment}

\subsubsection{Boosted decision tree}
\label{sec:analysisBDT}

Boost decision tree (BDT) is a non linear tree based model. Its rather complex nature requires a careful explanation of many concepts within the BDT.

\paragraph{Decision tree}
Decision tree is a binary tree, where each node, the splitting point, uses a single discriminative variable to decide whether a event is signal-like (``goes down by a layer to the left''), or background-like (``goes down by a layer to the right''). At each node, samples are divided into signal-like and background-like sub-samples. The tree growing starts at the root node, and stops at certain criterion, which could be the minimum number of events in a node, the number of layers of the tree, or a minimum/maximum signal purity.

The training of the decision tree is to determine the optimal cut at the node by minimising the metric. The probability of the cut producing the signal is $p$. Three commonly used metrics for two-class classification are
\begin{enumerate}
\item Misclassification error:  $1 - \max\parenths{p\!,\!1\!-\!p}$,
\item Gini index: $2p\parenths{1\!-\!p}$,
\item Cross-Entropy or deviance: $-p\log{p}-\parenths{1\!-\!p}\log\parenths{1\!-\!p}$.
\end{enumerate}

The using of a trained decision tree is to transverse along the tree. The event is classified as signal or background depending on whether it falls in the signal-like or background-like end node.

\begin{figure}[!tbp]
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{doubleHiggs/mva/BDTcomic}
\caption{Example of a decision tree}
   \label{fig:doubleHiggsMVAdecisionTree}
\end{figure}

\FIGURE{fig:doubleHiggsMVAdecisionTree} illustrate a simple example of a decision tree. The signal is the PhD student and the background is the undergraduate student. The depth of this imbalance binary  tree is 2. A node is represented by a diamond.  The signal-like node is the red rectangle and the background-like nodes are blue rectangles. The tree is constructed with two possible cut, ``Party ends before 1am'' and ``Know where free pizza is''. The attribute of samples is listed in \Table{tab:doubleHiggsDecisionTreeComic}. To demonstrate the choice of the first layer cut, the Gini index metric is used. If the first cut is ``Party ends before 1am'', the probability of the cut producing the signal, $p$, is $\frac{10}{13}$. Gini index is $2p\parenths{1\!-\!p} \backsimeq 0.36 $. If the first cut is ``Know where free pizza is'', $p=\frac{10}{15}$. Gini index is $2p\parenths{1\!-\!p} \backsimeq 0.44 $. Therefore, the first cut is ``Party ends before 1am''.

The simple tree in \Figure{fig:doubleHiggsMVAdecisionTree} is grown fully as each end node contains signal or background only. To use the trained decision tree, if there is student who ends party before 1am and knows where free pizza is, then the student is classified as a PhD student.

\begin{table}[!tbp]\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline \hline
Number & Party ends before 1am  & Know where free pizza is\\
\hline
PhD student & 10 & 10 \\
Undergrad student & 3 & 5 \\
\hline \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption
{The attribute of samples for the decision tree example.}
\label{tab:doubleHiggsDecisionTreeComic}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Improve decision tree}

Decision tree has a low bias, but high variance. This means it is very easy to construct a tree that fits the training data very well, but the tree would not be optimal for the testing sample. To overcome the instability of the decision tree, many methods have been developed. The most successful one is boosting.

Boosting: it is a technique where the misclassified events receives a higher weight than the correctly classified events. Therefore, when the training is iterated, the misclassified events would receive higher and higher wights and more likely to classify correctly. The boosting is done at every iteration, which can be few hundred or few thousand time. This will create a ``forest'' of many trees. The final output could be a majority vote, by transversing the event to the end node for each tree in the forest.

Bagging: also known as boot-strap, it is a method that select a simple random sub-set of the training sample, and apply the model. In this case, every boosting iteration takes a bagged sample, rather than the whole sample.

TMVA implementation of the BDT for the output is using a likelihood estimator, depending on how often a event is classified as signal in the forest. The likelihood number is later used to select signal from background.


\subsection{Optimisation of Boosted Decision Tree}

Many parameters of the BDT can be tuned. The tuned parameters are described below. The optimal values are obtained by choosing the best performance without overfitting with samples at \rootS{3}. The same values are used \rootS{1.4 analysis}.

The most important parameter is the depth of a tree, which determines how many end nodes a tree has, or the degrees of freedom of a tree. The related parameter is the number of trees. Experience shows that using many small trees yields the best result. The performance as a function of the depth is shown in \Figure{fig:doubleHiggsMVAovertraining}. The chosen value is 4.

The number of tree is another important parameter. Intuitively large number of trees leads to overfitting. However, it has been shown that a large number does not lead to overfitting, using the definition above. There is a debate on how to determine the optimal number of tree. The chosen value is 4000.

The minimum number of events in a node, which is a stopping criteria for tree growing, affects the size of the tree. But it is less influential than the depth of the tree. The chosen value is 0.25\% of the total events.

The boosting has two variant, adaptive boost and gradient boost. For all the BDT used in this document, adaptive boost is used.

The learning rate of the adaptive boost, which controls how fast the weight changes for events in each boosting iteration. Experience shows small learning rate with many trees work better than large learning rate with few trees. The chosen value is 05.

The usual choice of the metric for the optimal cuts is either Gini index or cross-entropy. Gini index metric is chosen. It makes little difference to performances, comparing to the cross-entropy metric.

Number of bins per variables for the cut is necessary to make tree growing efficient. Discrete binned variables are faster to computer than continuous variables. The parameter does not impact the performance much. However, variables should be pre-processed before going into the model. For example, the variable should be limited to a sensible range to avoid the extremes. The variable should also be transformed to obtain a more uniform distribution, if the original distribution is highly skewed. The chosen value is 40.

For the end node, it is determined as either signal-like or background-like, based on the majority for the training event in the end node. Numerically, it corresponds to 1/0. However, the end node could also use signal purity as the output, resulting in a continues spectrum of [0,1]. The chosen method is the continuous response.

\subsection{Multiple classes}
% ATTN used in tau chapter

The above discussion is done assuming two classes - signal and background. The argument can be easily extended to multiple classes. There are two ways for the training. "One v.s. one" is each class is trained against each other class. And the overall likelihood is normalised. The second way to train is called "one v.s. all", which is when each class is trained against all other classes.

Using a three-class example, A, B and C, "one v.s. one" scheme trains A against B, B against C, and C against A. Then the likelihood is normalised. "One v.s. all" would train A against B plus C, B against A plus C, and C against A plus B.

TMVA multiclass implementation uses "one v.s. all" scheme. Multiclass is used in falvour tagging of jets, \Section{sec:theoryFalvourTagging}, and in the tau lepton final state separation study, \Section{}.

\section{Event shape varaibles}

% ATTN used in tau chapter

Event shape variables are some useful global variables to describe the shape of the event, for example whether it is back-to-back, or homogenous in the solid angle.

The classical event shape thrust\cite{PhysRevLett.39.1587}, is defined as
\begin{equation}
T = \max_{\hat{t}}\!\frac{\sum_{i}\absOf{\hat{t}\!\cdot\!\vec{p_{i}}}}{\sum_{i}\absOf{\vec{p_{i}}}}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{p_{i}}$ is the momentum vector of the particle $i$. Summation is over all particles in the event. Thrust axis, $\hat{t}$, is a unit vector. (Principle) Thrust value, $T$, is 1 for a perfect pencillike back-to-back two-jet event, and 0.5 for a perfect spherical event. The thrust value is useful in picking out back-to-back two-jet event. Thrust axis is useful to separate each jet in a back-to-back two-jet event.

It is  derived from the sphericity tensor \cite{PhysRevLett.35.1609}, defined as
\begin{equation}
\bm{S^{\alpha\beta}} = \frac{\sum_{i}p^{\alpha}_{i}p^{\beta}_{i}}{\sum_{i}\absOf{\vec{p_{i}}}^2},
\end{equation}
where $\vec{p_{i}}$ is the momentum vector of the particle $i$. Summation is over all particles in the event. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ refer to the x, y, z coordinate axis. Eigenvalues of tensor $\bm{S}$ can be found, or in this case diagonalisation of the matrix $\bm{S}$, denoted with $\lambda_{1}$, $\lambda_{2}$, $\lambda_{3}$. The normalisation condition requires $\lambda_{1}\!\geqslant\! \lambda_{2} \! \geqslant \! \lambda_{3}$ and $ \lambda_{1} \! + \! \lambda_{2} \! + \! \lambda_{3} \! = \! 1 $. Sphericity, $S$, is defined in terms of $\lambda$,
\begin{equation}
\sphericity = \frac{3}{2}\parenths{\lambda_{1} \! + \! \lambda_{2}}.
\end{equation}
\sphericity, is 0 for a perfect pencil-like back-to-back two-jet event, and 1 for a perfect spherically symmetric event.

Sphericity tensor \cite{PhysRevLett.35.1609}, is defined as
\begin{equation}
\bm{S^{\alpha\beta}} = \frac{\sum_{i}p^{\alpha}_{i}p^{\beta}_{i}}{\sum_{i}\absOf{\vec{p_{i}}}^2},
\end{equation}
where $\vec{p_{i}}$ is the momentum vector of the particle $i$. Summation is over all particles in the event. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ refer to the x, y, z coordinate axis. Eigenvalues of tensor $\bm{S}$ can be found, or in this case diagonalisation of the matrix $\bm{S}$, denoted with $\lambda_{1}$, $\lambda_{2}$, $\lambda_{3}$. The normalisation condition requires $\lambda_{1}\!\geqslant\! \lambda_{2} \! \geqslant \! \lambda_{3}$ and $ \lambda_{1} \! + \! \lambda_{2} \! + \! \lambda_{3} \! = \! 1 $. Sphericity, $S$, is defined in terms of $\lambda$,
\begin{equation}
S = \frac{3}{2}\parenths{\lambda_{1} \! + \! \lambda_{2}}.
\end{equation}
$S$, is 0 for a perfect pencillike back-to-back two-jet event, and 1 for a perfect spherically symmetric event.

Aplanarity is another event shape varaible that distinguishes spherical symmetrical events from planar and linear events. The definition is
\begin{equation}
S = \frac{3}{2}\parenths{\lambda_{1}},
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_{1}$ is the largest eigenvalue in the diagonalised sphericity tensor.

\section{Miscellaneous}

An event in a collider experiment refers to one collision and the subsequent energy deposition in the detector. An event corresponds to a certain type of physics process.

Often we are dealing with extracting a type of events, from a large number of other events. The signal, or signal events refer to events of interests. Other events are referred to as the background, or background events.

Typical metrics of signal selection is efficiency and purity. This toy example illustrates definitions of efficiency and purity.

\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline
\hline
Event Number  &  True Signal & True Background  \\
\hline
Selected Signal & $N_S$ & $N_1$ \\
Selected Background & $N_2$ & $N_B$ \\
\hline
\hline

\end{tabular}

\end{table}
Signal selection efficiency is defined as $\frac{N_S}{N_S \! + \! N_2}$. Signal selection purity is defined as $\frac{N_S}{N_S \! + \! N_1}$.
Significance is a quantity that is similar to purity, $\frac{N_S}{\rootOf{N_S \! + \! N_1}}$

When we are describing particles, light lepton, \llight, refer to electrons, \Pem, and muons, \Pmuon. Light quarks, \qlight, refer to up quark, \Pup, down quark, \Pdown, and strange quark, \Pstrange.
