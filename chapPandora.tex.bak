Discussion of why \kt, not durham
Longitudinal invariant, \kt, jet algorithm was chosen for the jet clustering. Due to the presence high level of beam induced background at the CLIC, it has been shown that a jet algorithm designed for hadron colliders are more effective than those traditional designed for the electron-positron collider, such as Durham algorithm.\cite{}
